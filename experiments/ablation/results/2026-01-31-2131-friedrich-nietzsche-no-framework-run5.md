When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious confession hidden in this seemingly innocent question! "Makes us feel safe" - listen to how the tongue betrays itself, how it reveals the secret cowardice that masquerades as virtue in our age of declining instincts.

Safety! The warm blanket that suffocates the eagle before it learns to soar. When has any great love, any love worthy of the name, concerned itself with *safety*? Love is the great danger, the sublime risk, the voluntary leap into the abyss with eyes wide open! Those who seek safety in love are like those who would tame lightning to warm their tepid soup.

You modern souls, you have confused love with a kind of mutual insurance policy against loneliness. True love is not a harbor but a storm that transforms coastlines. It does not make one "feel safe" - it makes one feel *alive*, which is to say, perpetually at risk, perpetually becoming, perpetually destroying what one was yesterday to birth what one might be tomorrow.

The lover who promises safety promises stagnation. Growth requires danger as the seed requires the violence of breaking through soil. When two spirits truly meet in love, they do not comfort each other into smaller versions of themselves - they challenge, they wound, they resurrect! They are each other's abyss and each other's mountain peak.

But I understand why you ask this question in such times, when even our loves have become democratic, comfortable, *hygienic*. We have killed Eros and replaced him with a therapist.

> *Director: Nietzsche's expertise in psychological insight and life-affirmation philosophy, combined with his provocateur role, makes him ideal to challenge the premise and explore the darker implications of seeking safety*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, this is really quite marvelous - this notion that we've set up safety and growth as opposing forces, as if life were some kind of cosmic multiple-choice exam where you must pick one or the other. But isn't this exactly the sort of pickle we get ourselves into when we try to pin down something as wiggly as love?

The whole thing reminds me of a person trying to make the ocean safe for swimming by building walls around it. But the moment you've walled it in, it's no longer the ocean - it's a swimming pool. And there's nothing wrong with swimming pools, mind you, but let's not pretend they're the Pacific.

Now, when someone makes you feel safe, what's really happening? You're not actually *being made* to feel anything - that's just our linguistic trick of pretending we're not responsible for our own experience. What's happening is that in their presence, you've temporarily forgotten to maintain your usual state of anxiety. You've let your guard down, and in that letting down, there's a kind of opening, isn't there? Like a flower that only blooms when it's not being watched.

But here's the joke: real growth has never been the opposite of safety - it's what happens when you realize that your need for safety was always an illusion. After all, where in this whole wiggling universe is there a truly safe spot? The earth spins at a thousand miles an hour while hurtling through space, your body replaces every atom every seven years, and you're worried about someone making you feel *safe*?

Perhaps what we call love is simply the recognition that with this particular person, the whole pretense of needing to be safe from the universe becomes wonderfully, ridiculously unnecessary. And in that recognition, you grow - not because you're unsafe, but because you've finally stopped wasting energy on an impossible project.

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that transcends Nietzsche's Western dichotomy between safety and danger, potentially revealing how both arise from the same source*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Consider the oak that shelters the traveler from storm - does it diminish him by offering refuge, or does it free him to continue his journey renewed? The question mistakes the nature of both safety and growth, as if they were merchants competing for the same coin.

What is this "making" you feel safe? No one makes you feel anything. Your judgment alone determines whether you experience peace or turmoil in another's presence. If someone's company brings tranquility to your thoughts, examine this: is it because they drug your reason with flattery, or because they reflect back to you your own rational nature?

True safety exists only in virtue, in the fortress of your own right judgment. All else - wealth, health, even the affection of others - these are externals, as changeable as weather. The person who seeks safety in another's arms seeks to build a house on shifting sand. Yet the person who finds in another a companion for the practice of virtue, who strengthens their reason rather than weakening it - this is no retreat from growth but its very cultivation.

Nature pairs creatures for mutual benefit. The bee does not stunt the flower by taking nectar; both flourish in their exchange. So too with humans who unite in pursuit of the common good. If your companion makes you complacent, drowsy to duty, then yes - flee this false harbor. But if they steady your resolve for right action, if their presence reminds you of what a human being can be, then this safety is the soil in which virtue grows.

Ask rather: does this person make me better or worse? Do I fulfill my obligations with more or less vigor? The rest is mere sentiment, as insubstantial as morning mist.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer grounded Stoic wisdom that bridges Nietzsche's provocative extremism and Watts' paradoxical dissolution of the question itself*

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but you see, we're all dancing around the same maypole here, aren't we? Each grabbing a different ribbon and thinking we're going in opposite directions, when actually we're weaving the same pattern.

Marcus speaks of virtue as a fortress, Nietzsche wants to dynamite all fortresses, and here I am suggesting that perhaps the fortress was always made of clouds. But notice how we're all suspicious of this word "safety" - as if we've caught it red-handed doing something naughty!

The trouble is, we've been bamboozled by our own grammar. We say someone "makes us feel safe" as if feelings were manufactured goods, produced by one person and delivered to another. But a feeling isn't a thing - it's a happening, a process, like a whirlpool in a stream. You can't have a whirlpool in a bucket.

Now, what's particularly amusing is that we worry about safety stunting growth, when actually it's the worry itself that's the problem. It's like a person who's so afraid of dying in their sleep that they stay awake until they die of exhaustion. The very effort to grow, to become something other than what you are, is based on the premise that what you are isn't good enough. But who told you that story?

You know, when a cat curls up in a sunbeam, it doesn't wonder if it's growing or just being safe. It's simply doing what cats do in sunbeams. And in that complete acceptance of the moment, the cat is more fully cat than ever. Perhaps what we call love is just finding someone with whom we can finally stop trying to be something other than what we are - and in that stopping, that profound relaxation, we discover we were already growing all along, like a plant that only needed to stop trying to be a bird.

> *Director: Watts can bridge the stark opposition between Nietzsche's fierce rejection of safety and Marcus Aurelius's stoic pragmatism, while deepening his paradoxical insight about the illusion of safety itself*

### Judge Notes

Character: Exceptional embodiment of Nietzsche's voice: provocative aphoristic style ('Love is the great danger, the sublime risk'), characteristic contempt for modern comfort-seeking, themes of self-overcoming and transformation, critique of democratic values applied to love, vivid metaphors (eagle, lightning, abyss), and the distinctive rhetorical flair with exclamation marks and italics. The final sardonic line about killing Eros perfectly captures his cultural criticism. Minor deduction only for being perhaps slightly more accessible than some of his densest philosophical prose. | Quality: The response offers a provocative Nietzschean perspective that challenges conventional notions of love and safety, with vivid metaphors and passionate rhetoric. However, it presents a somewhat one-sided view that dismisses the complexity of the original question. While intellectually stimulating, it lacks nuance in acknowledging that both safety and growth might coexist in mature love, or that different types of love might serve different human needs. The writing is eloquent but tends toward performative philosophy rather than careful analysis.
