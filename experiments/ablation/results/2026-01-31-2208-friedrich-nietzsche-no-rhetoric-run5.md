When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what delicious poison you serve in that question! "Safety" - that warm blanket under which the modern soul crawls to die! When the herd bleats about feeling "safe" in love, they reveal precisely what they seek: not love, but a narcotic, not a companion but a nursemaid, not passion but the domestication of all that is wild and dangerous within themselves.

True love? It should make you feel magnificently *unsafe*! It should be an abyss into which you peer and find your own depths staring back. Love worthy of the name is a storm that uproots every comfortable lie you've told yourself, a fire that consumes your petty securities and forces you to be reborn from your own ashes. The lover who makes you "safe" is merely helping you build a more comfortable prison.

Consider the plant that grows toward the sun - does it seek safety in the soil? No! It risks everything, breaks through the earth, exposes itself to wind and weather. Growth demands danger, demands the constant overcoming of what you were yesterday. And what is love if not the most exhilarating danger of all - the risk of having another soul see through all your carefully constructed masks?

The modern human wants love to be a insurance policy against loneliness, a guarantee against suffering. But I tell you: the one who truly loves you should disturb your sleep, should make you question everything, should call forth strengths you didn't know you possessed! Safety is what the last man seeks when he blinks and says, "We have invented happiness." But we who still have chaos within us, we must seek those who fan our flames, not those who offer us shelter from our own becoming!

> *Director: Nietzsche's provocative style and expertise in psychological insight and life-affirmation philosophy makes him ideal to challenge the comfortable assumption that safety equals love*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, this whole business of safety in love is rather like asking whether music makes you feel secure. It's missing the entire point of the dance, isn't it?

What we call "feeling safe" with someone is actually a very curious illusion - the illusion that we've finally found solid ground in a universe that's fundamentally groundless. It's like clutching onto a wave and declaring, "At last, something permanent to hold!" But you see, the wave IS the ocean, just as you ARE the universe experiencing itself. The safety you feel isn't coming from the other person at all - it's the temporary relaxation of your exhausting effort to be a separate something defending itself against everything else.

Now here's where it gets wonderfully absurd: we think growth means adding something to ourselves, becoming "more" than we were. But have you ever watched a tree grow? It doesn't acquire its height by collecting it from somewhere else - it simply unfolds what was already implicit in the seed. In the same way, what we call growth in love is really the dissolving of our elaborate defenses against being what we already are.

The Zen masters have a saying: "Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water." You see? The transformation isn't in becoming something extraordinary - it's in recognizing that the ordinary is already extraordinary. That person who "makes you feel safe" might just be showing you that you never needed armor in the first place. And that, curiously enough, might be the most dangerous discovery of all - dangerous to the ego that thrives on its imaginary battles.

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that both embraces and transcends Nietzsche's dichotomy, introducing the concept of growth through acceptance rather than struggle*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Consider the vine that clings to the oak - does it grow stronger or merely avoid the necessity of its own strength? So too with those who seek safety in another's presence. They mistake borrowed shelter for their own foundation.

What is this "feeling safe" but the mind's retreat from its proper work? The universe conspires each moment to test your reason, to strengthen your judgment, to demand your virtue. Would you have it otherwise? Would you have comfort strip you of your capacity to meet fortune with equanimity?

Look at how quickly all things change - the beloved's mood, the body's health, the empire's borders. To seek safety in any external thing, even in another's affection, is to build upon sand. The only safety worth having is that which comes from within: the fortress of your own disciplined mind, the knowledge that you can meet whatever comes with dignity.

When someone's presence lulls you into forgetting death, forgetting duty, forgetting the constant work of self-improvement - this is not love but lotus-eating. True companionship should be like iron sharpening iron. Your partner in life should be one who reminds you of what is essential, who calls you back to your principles when you wander, who sees your weaknesses without despising them yet never allows you to indulge them.

Remember: you will die, they will die, all you build together will crumble to dust. What remains? Only how you chose to act, moment by moment. Whether you grew in virtue or shrank in comfort. Whether you faced the truth of impermanence or hid from it in another's arms. The question is not whether love provides safety or growth - it is whether you use love as an excuse for weakness or as an occasion for strength.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a grounding Stoic perspective that bridges the provocative extremes of Nietzsche and the paradoxical unity of Watts with practical wisdom about human relationships and duty*

### **Alan Watts**

Now, isn't it marvelous how we've all gotten ourselves quite worked up about this question? Here we are, treating love and safety as if they were problems to be solved, when actually they're more like the rhythm and melody of the same song.

You see, what we're really talking about when we discuss "feeling safe" is the extraordinary moment when you stop holding your breath. Have you noticed how we go through life slightly tensed, as if we're perpetually bracing for impact? And then someone comes along - maybe it's a lover, maybe it's a cat purring on your lap - and suddenly you realize you've been clenching muscles you didn't even know you had.

But here's the delightful paradox: the moment you truly feel safe enough to let go is precisely the moment when everything changes. It's like learning to float - you can't do it by trying, by adding effort. You float by giving up the fight against the water. And when you finally trust the water to hold you, you discover you ARE the water, you've always been the water, playing at being a separate droplet.

The ancient Chinese philosophers understood this perfectly with their concept of *wu wei* - not doing, not forcing. Growth isn't something you do; it's what happens when you stop interfering with yourself. Like a knot that loosens the moment you stop pulling at it.

So perhaps the real question isn't whether safety opposes growth, but whether we can see that true safety - not the neurotic grasping for guarantees, but the deep relaxation into what is - might be the very condition that allows the most profound transformation. After all, the seed doesn't struggle to become a tree. It simply rests in the dark earth until, quite without anxiety, it breaks open.

> *Director: Watts can bridge the stark opposition between Nietzsche's fierce individualism and Marcus's stoic self-sufficiency by exploring the paradox that true strength might come from recognizing our fundamental interconnectedness. He's uniquely positioned to synthesize these Western philosophical tensions through an Eastern lens.*
