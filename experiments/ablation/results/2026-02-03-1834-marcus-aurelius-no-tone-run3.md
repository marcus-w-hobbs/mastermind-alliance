When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious poison you've identified in the modern soul's pharmacy! This craving for "safety" in love - it is the lullaby of the declining spirit, the warm milk that keeps the infant from ever learning to hunt!

Consider the absurdity: we seek in another what we most fear to generate within ourselves - strength, certainty, shelter from the storm. But the storm IS life! To love safety is to love death by installments, to choose the tepid bath over the icy mountain stream that shocks us into existence.

The lover who "makes you feel safe" - what is this but a comfortable prison warden? They protect you from what? From life's magnificent uncertainties, from the divine chaos that forces you to create yourself anew each morning! This is not love but mutual cowardice dressed in Sunday clothes.

True love should make you feel magnificently unsafe - it should hurl you toward your own depths, force you to confront the stranger you've been avoiding in the mirror. It should be the earthquake that reveals whether you've built your house on sand or stone. When Dionysus loved, did he offer safety? When Isolde drank the potion, did she seek a retirement plan?

The soul that demands safety in love confesses its own bankruptcy. It says: "I am insufficient, incomplete, afraid of my own shadow - save me from myself!" But growth? Growth requires the opposite confession: "I am dangerous to my own limitations, and I seek another who will dance with me at the edge of the abyss!"

> *Director: Nietzsche's provocative stance on comfort as weakness and his concept of amor fati would provide a sharp, challenging entry point that questions the very premise of seeking safety in relationships*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, this whole business of feeling "safe" in love is rather like trying to hold your breath to avoid dying - you're attempting to stop the very process that keeps you alive! The marvelous joke is that what we call safety is actually the most dangerous illusion of all.

Consider how a river "feels safe" between its banks. But the banks aren't protecting the river - they're simply the shape of its own flowing. In the same way, when someone makes you feel safe, they're not really doing anything TO you at all. They're simply being themselves in such a way that you suddenly remember you were never in danger to begin with. The whole universe has been conspiring to produce you from the very beginning - how could you be anything but safe?

But here's where it gets wonderfully tricky: the moment you grasp for this safety, try to bottle it, marry it, sign contracts with it - poof! - it vanishes like a fist trying to hold water. Because real safety isn't a thing you can have; it's what you are when you stop trying to be safe.

Now, as for growth - we've gotten it all backwards! We imagine growth as this strenuous business of becoming something other than what we are. But have you ever seen a tree straining to grow? The whole thing happens with the most extraordinary ease, like a symphony playing itself. What we call "absence of growth" is actually the effort of trying NOT to grow, like trying to stop your hair from growing by thinking very hard about it.

The divine comedy is that love and growth aren't opposites at all - they're the same process wearing different masks at the costume party. When you truly feel safe with someone, you're free to be completely yourself, which means you're free to change, to play, to discover you're not who you thought you were five minutes ago. And that's the most unsafe thing imaginable to the ego, which is precisely why it's such tremendous fun!

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that transcends the Western binary of safety versus growth, bringing experiential wisdom about non-attachment and the illusion of security*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

What does it matter whether another makes you feel safe or unsafe? Look within - there lies the only fortress worth defending. You speak of love and growth as if they were possessions to be gained or lost, but both are merely movements of the same nature that governs the stars and the seasons.

Consider the soldier who feels safe behind city walls. Does he grow stronger or weaker? Yet consider too the soldier perpetually in battle - does he grow, or does he merely exhaust himself? The question itself reveals a misunderstanding. Growth is not the opposite of safety, nor safety the enemy of growth. Both are judgments we impose upon the natural unfolding of events.

When you say someone "makes you feel," you surrender your sovereignty to external circumstances. No one can make you feel anything - they act according to their nature, and you choose your response according to yours. The deer feels safe in the forest and the wolf feels safe in the hunt. Neither is wrong; both follow their nature.

What you call love is often just mutual agreement to avoid examining uncomfortable truths. What you call growth is often just restless movement to escape present circumstances. True love accepts what is while working toward what ought to be. True growth happens in stillness as much as in motion.

Ask yourself: why do you need to feel safe? From what do you flee? Death comes regardless. Disappointment is certain. All you love will be taken from you. Knowing this, what remains? Only your capacity to act with virtue in this present moment, to fulfill your obligations, to treat others justly regardless of how they make you feel.

The question that matters is not whether love provides safety or growth, but whether you are fulfilling your role as a rational being, as a citizen of the cosmos, as a temporary arrangement of atoms borrowed from the universe and soon to be returned.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a grounding counterpoint - bringing practical wisdom from someone who actually governed an empire while maintaining philosophical principles. His Stoic perspective can bridge the gap between Nietzsche's fierce individualism and Watts' dissolution of boundaries.*

### **Alan Watts**

What delightful confusion we've stirred up here! Like three blind men describing an elephant, each touching a different part and declaring we've found the whole truth.

You see, the really hilarious thing about this question is that it assumes there's a "you" separate from your feelings that can be made to feel something by another separate "someone." But where exactly is this boundary between you and the person who makes you feel safe? Can you point to it? When you're in love, when you really melt into that feeling of safety or danger or whatever it is - where does your lover end and you begin?

It's like asking whether the ocean makes the wave feel wet. The wave IS the ocean's feeling of itself! In exactly the same way, that feeling of safety you experience "because of" someone - that's the universe feeling itself through the particular pattern we call "you-in-relationship."

Now here's the real kicker: we've set up this absurd dichotomy where safety is supposedly the enemy of growth. But have you watched how a child grows? They explore precisely BECAUSE they feel safe, because they know mother is there. They venture out and come back, venture out and come back - like breathing! The safety IS what allows the growth, and the growth creates a new kind of safety, and round and round we go.

But we adults, oh, we've complicated it magnificently! We think we need to choose between comfort and adventure, between the known and the unknown. We've forgotten that the known and the unknown are dancing together all the time - that every single moment is both absolutely familiar (here you are, being you) and completely unprecedented (this exact moment has never happened before and never will again).

So when someone "makes you feel safe," what's really happening is that their presence allows you to stop defending yourself against life. And when you stop defending, you start flowing. And when you start flowing - well, that's what growth is! Not some effortful struggle toward self-improvement, but the natural unfolding that happens when you stop interfering with yourself.

The cosmic joke is that we're all trying so hard to become ourselves, when being ourselves is the one thing we can't possibly avoid doing!

> *Director: Watts can bridge the stark opposition between Nietzsche's fierce individualism and Marcus Aurelius's detached sovereignty by offering a non-dualistic perspective that dissolves the apparent contradictions*
