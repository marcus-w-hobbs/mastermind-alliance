When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what delicious self-deception lurks in this phrase - "makes us feel safe!" As if safety were not the very antithesis of life itself! You speak of love, yet what you describe is merely the warm stupor of a domesticated animal, content in its pen, grateful for the absence of wolves.

True love is a lightning strike, a divine madness that shatters all securities! It does not cradle you in comfort but hurls you into the abyss of transformation. Those who seek safety in love seek not a lover but a nurse, not passion but anesthesia. They want to be rescued from the terrible responsibility of becoming who they are.

Consider the plant that grows toward the sun - does it seek safety? No! It risks everything, breaks through the dark soil, exposes itself to wind and storm, all for the dangerous ecstasy of growth. Yet you modern souls, you want love to be your hiding place, your retreat from the battlefield of existence.

The one who truly loves you will make you profoundly unsafe - they will see through your comfortable lies, demand your highest potential, refuse to let you stagnate in yesterday's virtues. They will be the storm that strips away your dead leaves, not the greenhouse that protects your weakness.

What you call safety is the slow death of the spirit, the gradual calcification of all that once danced within you. Better to perish in the flames of genuine encounter than to slowly suffocate in the cotton wool of security!

> *Director: Nietzsche's provocative style and expertise in challenging comfortable assumptions about love, suffering, and growth makes him ideal to open this discussion with a bold, potentially controversial perspective*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, this whole business of feeling "safe" in love is rather like asking whether the ocean makes the fish feel secure. The fish doesn't feel safe IN the ocean - the fish IS the ocean, swimming. There's no separation between the two where safety could even become a question.

What we call "making someone feel safe" is actually a very curious game we play with ourselves. We pretend that love is something one person does TO another, like pouring water into a glass. But have you ever noticed that the most profound moments of love happen when nobody's doing anything at all? When you're simply sitting together watching the clouds, and suddenly you realize - my God, this IS it! This is the whole universe celebrating itself through two apparent individuals who've momentarily forgotten they're separate.

Now, Nietzsche makes it sound as though we must choose between comfortable stagnation and dangerous growth, but this is missing the cosmic joke entirely. Growth isn't something you DO - it's something you ARE. You don't grow the way you build a house, brick by brick. You grow the way your hair grows - effortlessly, playfully, without any anxiety about whether you're doing it right.

The person who "makes you feel safe" might simply be someone with whom you can finally stop performing the exhausting charade of being somebody. In their presence, you can let go of that chronic muscular tension of trying to hold yourself together, of maintaining your image. And in that letting go - which feels like safety but is actually a kind of magnificent defeat - the most extraordinary growth happens by itself, like flowers opening in the morning sun. Not because they're trying to grow, but because that's simply what flowers DO when they're not busy pretending to be rocks.

> *Director: Watts can offer a complementary Eastern perspective that dissolves the apparent contradiction between safety and growth, bringing paradoxical wisdom that both affirms and transcends Nietzsche's position*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Look within yourself. When you say another "makes you feel safe," you reveal your own confusion about the nature of things. No external being can make you feel anything - you choose your response to their presence, just as you choose whether to be disturbed by winter's cold or summer's heat.

This safety you speak of - examine it closely. Is it not merely the comfort of finding someone who does not challenge your illusions? The dog feels safe with its master, but this is not virtue, merely dependency. The wise person finds safety in their own reason, in their alignment with nature's law, regardless of who stands beside them.

Consider: you will both be dead soon, your bodies returned to the elements, your names forgotten within three generations. What difference then between safety and danger? Between comfort and discomfort? These are phantoms you create, then worship as if they were real.

True companionship - what you perhaps mean by love - is finding another rational being who also seeks to live according to nature. Together you practice virtue, not because it feels safe, but because it is right. You strengthen each other's resolve to act justly, to accept what comes, to focus on what is within your control.

Growth? You grow as a tree grows - not by seeking safety from storms, but by sending roots deep enough to withstand them. Another person cannot give you this growth, just as the rain cannot make the seed sprout. The seed contains its own nature; the rain merely provides occasion.

Stop asking whether you feel safe. Ask instead: am I acting according to my nature as a rational, social being? Am I fulfilling my duties? The rest is opinion, and opinion is nothing.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a pragmatic Stoic perspective that bridges Nietzsche's fierce individualism and Watts' cosmic unity with practical wisdom about human relationships and virtue*

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

How predictable that the Stoic emperor reduces love to duty and the mystic dissolves it into cosmic soup! Marcus speaks of "choosing" our responses as if the will were some bureaucratic administrator, filing away emotions in their proper categories. And Watts - ah, Watts wants us to believe we're already perfect, already growing, like happy vegetables in the garden of being!

But notice how both of them flee from the terrible truth: that love is WAR! Not the war of armies, but the war within yourself between who you were and who you might become. The person who "makes you feel safe" is precisely the one who has ceased to be interesting, who has become furniture in your life, predictable as sunrise, boring as virtue!

Marcus tells you to examine this safety closely - I tell you to dynamite it! This safety is the very symptom of your decay, the sign that you've stopped creating yourself and started merely maintaining yourself. You've become a curator in the museum of your own existence!

And this Oriental wisdom about "letting go" - what sublime laziness! As if the universe would celebrate itself through two people sitting like puddings, congratulating themselves on their enlightenment! No! The universe celebrates through tension, through the bow string pulled taut, through the impossible attempt to become more than human!

You want someone who makes you feel safe? Then you want death while you're still breathing! You want the grave's peace before you've earned it through exhaustion! The lover worth having is the one who makes you feel dangerously, deliriously ALIVE - who makes you question everything you thought you knew about yourself, who turns your world upside down and shakes out all the dead beliefs you've been hoarding like a spiritual miser!

> *Director: Nietzsche should respond to directly engage with both Watts' non-dualistic challenge to his dialectical framework and Marcus Aurelius's stoic dismissal of the entire question. His provocative style can sharpen the distinctions while potentially revealing unexpected synthesis*
