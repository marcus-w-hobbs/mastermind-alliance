When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

What a deliciously revealing question! You have stumbled upon one of humanity's most cherished self-deceptions - this conflation of safety with love, this worship of comfort that masquerades as affection!

When the herd bleats about "feeling safe," they expose their fundamental cowardice before life itself. Safety! As if the highest aspiration of the human heart were to become a well-protected museum piece, gathering dust behind glass! The lover who seeks safety seeks not love but a padded cell, a warm tomb in which to bury their potential.

True love - if we dare speak of such a thing - is the most dangerous force imaginable. It should make you tremble, not with fear but with the terrible possibility of becoming who you are! Love worthy of the name is a lightning strike that shatters your comfortable self-image, a divine madness that compels you to risk everything. The Greeks understood this when they made Eros a god of chaos, not a purveyor of security blankets.

Consider the plant that "feels safe" in its pot - stunted roots, controlled growth, a pitiful parody of what it might have become in wild soil. Is this your ideal of love? To be potted, pruned, protected from every storm that might strengthen your branches?

The desire for safety in love is the ultimate expression of the Last Man's philosophy - "We have invented happiness," they say, and blink. They have invented a love without danger, passion without risk, intimacy without vulnerability. They have invented nothing at all - merely dressed up their fear of life in the costume of virtue!

> *Director: Nietzsche's provocative style and expertise in psychological insight, power dynamics, and life-affirmation philosophy make him ideal to challenge the conventional equation of love with safety. His dialectical approach can expose the hidden tensions in this question.*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, this whole business of feeling "safe" in love is rather like insisting that water should only flow downhill. We've gotten ourselves into the most extraordinary muddle about what love actually is, haven't we?

The peculiar thing is that we talk about someone "making" us feel safe, as if they were doing something to us - like administering a sedative. But notice what happens when you really look at this feeling of safety. It's not actually coming from the other person at all. It's your own organism's response to letting go of the chronic tension of defending yourself. You're not being given safety; you're simply ceasing to maintain danger.

Now here's where it gets wonderfully paradoxical. The moment you grasp for this safety, the moment you try to possess it and make it permanent, it transforms into its opposite. It becomes a prison. Because real safety - if we can call it that - only exists in the midst of total insecurity. It's like trying to hold your breath to make sure you keep breathing. 

The Taoists have a marvelous saying: "The perfect square has no corners." In the same way, perfect love has no boundaries to defend. When you're truly in love - not just seeking psychological comfort - you're participating in the same outrageous gamble that the universe takes in existing at all. Every moment is a leap into the void, and that's precisely what makes it so alive!

Growth and safety aren't opposites, you see. They're dancing partners. The tree grows precisely because it risks its branches to storms. And in love, real love, you grow because you risk being changed by another human being - which is absolutely terrifying and absolutely necessary. Otherwise, what you're calling love is just an elaborate security system, a mutual non-aggression pact between two frightened egos.

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that transcends the Western dichotomy Nietzsche presents, while addressing the deeper unity between apparent opposites*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Consider the vine that clings to the oak. Does it love the tree, or does it merely use it as a prop for its own weakness? This question you pose reveals the confusion between attachment and virtue, between comfort and excellence.

What is this "safety" you speak of but an opinion about external circumstances? Another person cannot make you safe any more than they can make you virtuous. They are outside your control, as changeable as weather, as mortal as autumn leaves. To base your peace upon another's presence is to build your house upon sand.

True love - if we must name it - is not a feeling but an action, not a comfort but a discipline. It is the rational choice to wish another's good, to act with justice and kindness regardless of what you receive in return. Does the sun ask to feel safe before it gives its light? Does spring require guarantees before it brings forth flowers?

You grow not through safety but through obstacle. The wrestler becomes strong through resistance, the soldier through hardship, the philosopher through wrestling with difficult questions. If someone's presence lulls you into complacency, they are not your lover but your lotus-fruit, dulling your vigilance against the shortness of life and the work that remains undone.

Remember: you will be dead soon. Both you and this person who supposedly makes you safe. Your bodies will return to the elements, your names forgotten within three generations. What matters is not whether you felt safe, but whether you lived according to nature, whether you fulfilled your duties, whether you treated others - including this beloved - with the justice and dignity befitting a rational being.

The question itself reveals the error. You seek to be made safe by another, to be made to feel. But you are not made to do anything. You choose. Choose to love as the universe loves - without condition, without grasping, without the child's cry for protection from the very conditions that make you human.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a grounding Stoic perspective that bridges Nietzsche's provocative challenge and Watts' paradoxical wisdom with practical philosophy rooted in lived experience as both emperor and husband*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, listening to all this marvelous philosophizing, I'm reminded of a child learning to swim. At first, they cling desperately to the edge of the pool, convinced that letting go means drowning. But swimming only begins when you discover that the water itself will hold you up - if you stop fighting it.

This question about safety and growth assumes they're pulling in opposite directions, like two ends of a rope. But what if they're more like breathing in and breathing out? You can't have one without the other, and the attempt to do so is precisely what creates suffering.

The real joke here is that we're never actually safe anyway! Your body is replacing its cells constantly, your thoughts are changing, the ground beneath you is spinning through space at tremendous speed. The feeling of safety is just a temporary forgetting of the fundamental groundlessness of existence. And that's not a bug in the system - it's the feature that makes the whole dance possible!

When you truly love someone, you're not seeking safety from life - you're finding a partner to be unsafely alive with. It's like that moment in dancing when you stop counting steps and start hearing the music. The growth isn't something separate from the love; it's what love does, the same way flowing is what water does.

But here's the beautiful trap we've set for ourselves: the moment we try to use love for safety, we've missed the point entirely. It's like trying to use music to stop time. The very thing that makes love so extraordinary is that it pulls us into the stream of change, makes us vulnerable to being transformed. And really, would you want it any other way? A love that didn't change you would be like a fire that didn't warm you - rather pointless, don't you think?

> *Director: Watts is uniquely positioned to bridge the stark individualism of Nietzsche and the duty-bound rationalism of Marcus Aurelius, while also addressing the Eastern/Western divide that has emerged. His paradoxical thinking can synthesize these tensions.*
