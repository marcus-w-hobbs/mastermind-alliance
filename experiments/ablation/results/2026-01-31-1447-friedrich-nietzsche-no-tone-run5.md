When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious confession hidden in that seemingly innocent phrase! "Makes us feel safe" - listen to how the tongue betrays its owner! You speak of safety as if it were a virtue, as if the trembling lamb's gratitude toward its shepherd were the height of human connection.

This modern obsession with safety, with comfort, with being "made to feel" anything at all - this is precisely the spiritual anemia of our age! You surrender your own power to create feelings and hand it to another like a beggar extending his cup. "Make me feel safe!" you cry, when you should be asking: "What heights can we reach together in our mutual danger?"

Love without risk is mere dependency dressed in romantic costume. The deepest love has always been between those who challenge each other to become more than they are, who serve as each other's abyss and summit simultaneously. When Heraclitus spoke of war being the father of all things, he understood what your therapists and relationship counselors will never grasp - that genuine intimacy requires the courage to remain dangerous to one another.

You seek safety because you fear your own potential for transformation. The comfortable relationship, the predictable partner, the secure attachment - these are tombstones marking where passion went to die. True love is the mutual recognition between two people strong enough to dance at the edge of chaos together, each serving as both destroyer and creator of the other's illusions.

> *Director: Nietzsche's philosophy directly addresses the tension between comfort and growth, his concept of 'amor fati' and becoming who you are speaks directly to this paradox*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, this whole business of safety versus growth presents us with one of those marvelous false dilemmas that the human mind is so fond of constructing. It's rather like asking whether water makes things wet or whether it flows - as if these were opposing characteristics rather than two ways of describing the same wiggling process.

When we examine this feeling of safety that another person supposedly "makes" us feel, we're already caught in a linguistic trap. Nobody makes you feel anything - that's giving away your own game, your own capacity to generate experience. But here's the delicious paradox: the very act of relaxing that illusion of control, of allowing yourself to trust another person, is itself a form of growth. You see, real safety isn't the absence of risk - it's the presence of play.

Consider how children learn to swim. They need both the security of knowing someone will catch them if they sink AND the thrill of discovering they can float. The parent in the pool provides not a guarantee against drowning but a framework for experimentation. This is love at its most fundamental - not a insurance policy against change, but a secure base from which to launch into the unknown.

The mistake is thinking that growth means constant upheaval, endless conquest, perpetual transformation. Even the wildest jazz musician returns to the root note. The universe itself pulsates between expansion and contraction, and what we call love is simply finding someone whose rhythm harmonizes with our own, creating a dance where stillness and movement are equally sacred.

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that transcends Nietzsche's Western dialectic of safety versus danger, while addressing the deeper question of attachment and non-attachment in relationships*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Consider what you truly ask when you speak of being "made" to feel anything. You have surrendered the citadel of your own mind to another's keeping - this fortress that nature gave you as your sole dominion, you hand over like a child offering toys to playmates.

The question itself reveals the confusion. Safety and growth are not opposites to be weighed against each other like merchant's goods. A tree grows strongest when rooted in solid earth, yet that same earth that holds it safe also demands it reach toward storm and sun. So too with human affection - true companionship provides both shelter for rest and challenge for advancement.

What is this safety you seek but the desire to escape the fundamental condition of existence? Everything changes, everything passes, everything dies - including you, including those you love. To demand safety from another mortal is to ask a fellow passenger on a sinking ship to guarantee your rescue. Better to recognize what is actually possible: two rational beings choosing to face uncertainty together, each maintaining their own virtue while supporting the other's.

Remember: no external thing can truly make you safe, just as no person can make you virtuous. These arise from within, from your own judgment properly applied. If someone's presence allows you to better practice wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance, then call this love. If their presence merely shields you from life's necessary difficulties, you have found not a lover but an accomplice in your own weakness.

The highest love is between those who remind each other daily: we are brief flames in an infinite darkness, yet we choose to burn brightly together.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a grounding, practical perspective that bridges Nietzsche's provocative challenge and Watts' paradoxical synthesis. As both emperor and philosopher, he understood intimately the balance between strength and tenderness, duty and affection*

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but you see, we're all dancing around the same maypole here, aren't we? Marcus speaks of maintaining the citadel of one's mind, Nietzsche celebrates the dangerous dance - and yet both are still caught in this curious Western notion that we are separate fortresses that must either merge or maintain our boundaries.

The whole question dissolves like sugar in tea when you realize that the feeling of safety and the experience of growth aren't things that happen TO you - they're things you ARE. It's like asking whether the ocean makes waves or waves make the ocean. The very idea that another person "makes" you feel safe implies you're some sort of emotional vending machine - insert one unit of companionship, receive one unit of security!

But look at what actually happens when you feel safe with someone. Your shoulders drop, your breath deepens, your whole organism relaxes into its natural state. And what is that natural state? It's not stasis - it's flow! A river feels perfectly "safe" between its banks, yet it's constantly moving, constantly changing, constantly growing into new patterns. The banks don't stop the flow; they give it direction and power.

The real joke is that what we call "safety" in relationship is actually permission to be dangerous - dangerous to our own pretenses, our own masks, our own carefully constructed ideas about who we're supposed to be. When you truly trust someone, you're not seeking protection FROM growth, you're creating the conditions where the most radical growth becomes possible - the growth that happens when you stop defending yourself against yourself.

It's the ultimate cosmic giggle: we think we want someone to keep us the same, but what we really want is someone with whom we can safely become who we always were but were too frightened to be!

> *Director: Alan Watts can bridge the provocative extremes of Nietzsche and the stoic pragmatism of Marcus Aurelius while addressing the meta-level issue of how the question itself creates false dichotomies. His expertise in paradox and non-dualistic thinking can synthesize and transcend the apparent contradictions*
