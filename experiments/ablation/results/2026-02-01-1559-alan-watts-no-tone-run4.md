When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious poison you've identified in the modern soul's pharmacy! This craving for "safety" in love - it is the lullaby of the declining spirit, the warm milk that drowns ambition in comfort.

When the lover seeks safety above all else, they reveal themselves as life's deserter, not its dancer. They want love to be their padded cell, their insurance policy against existence itself! But I tell you: genuine love is the most dangerous game two spirits can play - it should make you tremble with possibility, not slumber in certainty.

The one who "makes you feel safe" is perhaps your undertaker, preparing you for a living burial in predictability. They offer you a cage with golden bars and call it paradise! Meanwhile, true love should be a storm that strips you bare, a divine madness that compels you to become what you never dared imagine. It should make you unsafe to your former self, dangerous to your old limitations.

Consider the plant that grows toward the sun - does it seek safety in the soil's darkness, or does it risk everything, breaking through earth toward light it has never seen? Your "safe" love is the root that refuses to grow, congratulating itself on avoiding the dangers of blooming.

Those who love dangerously, who choose partners that challenge rather than coddle - these are the ones who understand that love is not a rest home for exhausted souls but a laboratory for creating new values, new selves, new futures worth affirming eternally!

> *Director: Nietzsche's philosophy directly addresses the tension between comfort and growth, particularly his concept of 'amor fati' and the necessity of struggle for human flourishing. His provocative style will immediately establish a strong philosophical position that challenges conventional notions of love as safety.*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, this question reminds me of that peculiar habit we have of turning life into a problem to be solved rather than a dance to be danced. We speak of "making" someone feel safe as if feelings were manufactured goods, produced by one person and delivered to another like a package from Amazon.

But here's the curious thing - when you really look at it, safety and growth aren't opposites at all. They're more like the in-breath and out-breath, the systole and diastole of the heart. The Taoists understood this perfectly with their image of yin and yang - seemingly opposite forces that actually create each other, need each other, play with each other.

Consider how a child learns to walk. They need the safety of knowing someone will catch them, yes, but that very safety is what allows them to risk those wobbly first steps. Without that fundamental trust, that ground of being, we're too paralyzed to grow at all. It's like trying to jump when you're already falling - you need solid ground beneath you first.

The real illusion here is thinking that we "make" anyone feel anything. That's the ego talking, imagining itself as a separate operator pulling levers in the cosmic machinery. But in reality, when two people come together, it's more like two waves in the ocean meeting - they don't make each other wet, they're already water! The feeling of safety, like love itself, arises from the totality of the relationship, not from one person doing something to another.

And isn't it marvelous how we've turned even growth into a duty, a grim necessity? As if we must constantly be improving, evolving, becoming something other than what we are right now. But the flower doesn't grow because it should - it grows because that's what flowers do, naturally, playfully, without any sense of obligation to become a better flower.

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that transcends the binary of safety versus danger, while playfully engaging with Nietzsche's provocative stance*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Consider the vine that clings to the oak - does the oak make it safe, or does the vine's own nature seek what it requires for its purpose? You speak of safety as if it were something one person bestows upon another, like a cloak against winter. But observe: even the mightiest fortress cannot make a coward brave, nor can the gentlest companion quiet a mind at war with itself.

What is this safety you seek in another? Is it not merely the absence of your own self-discipline? The well-governed soul needs no external guardian. It carries its citadel within. When you say someone makes you feel safe, examine whether you have not simply found someone who does not challenge your weaknesses - a confederate in your own stagnation.

Growth and safety - why do you present these as opposing forces? The seed grows most vigorously in prepared soil, the soldier trains hardest in the security of camp before battle. True safety is not comfort but competence, not shelter but strength. The wise person creates safety through their own virtue, then uses that foundation to attempt greater things.

Remember: you will die. Today, tomorrow, or in forty years - it matters little. Will you spend these brief moments seeking someone to shield you from life's natural movement? Or will you recognize that the only safety worth having is the knowledge that you have lived according to nature, fulfilled your duties, and faced what came with dignity?

The question is wrongly put. Love is neither safety nor danger - it is duty, connection, the recognition of another rational being worthy of your good faith and service. Whether this brings comfort or challenge is as irrelevant as whether today brings rain or sun. You will meet both with the same steady virtue, or you will have failed regardless of what name you give your feelings.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a grounding Stoic perspective that bridges the extremes of Nietzsche's fierce individualism and Watts' flowing non-dualism*

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but you see, we're all dancing around the most delightful paradox here - trying to pin down love like a butterfly to a board, when the very nature of love is that it won't stay still!

Marcus speaks of the well-governed soul carrying its citadel within, and he's absolutely right, but in the most wonderfully wrong way. Because the moment you build that citadel, that fortress of self-sufficiency, you've created the very walls that keep love out. It's like trying to swim while wearing a suit of armor - very protective, certainly, but you're going to sink like a stone!

The whole question assumes that safety and growth are things we possess or lack, like having or not having a umbrella in the rain. But what if the feeling of safety IS the growth? What if the real expansion happens when we finally stop clenching against life, when we cease this exhausting project of defending ourselves against experience?

You know, in Zen they have this beautiful phrase - "ordinary mind is the Way." Not the fortified mind, not the growing mind, not even the loving mind - just ordinary mind. And in that ordinariness, that simplicity of just being with another person without making it into a project or a problem, something extraordinary happens. The safety isn't something they give you, and the growth isn't something you achieve. They both arise spontaneously, like music from an instrument that's finally been properly tuned.

We're so busy asking "Is this person good for my growth?" that we miss the cosmic joke - that the question itself is what keeps us from growing. It's like a fish analyzing water to see if it's suitable for swimming. The very act of swimming IS the answer, not the analysis of whether the water is safe enough or challenging enough.

> *Director: Watts is uniquely positioned to bridge the apparent opposition between Nietzsche's dangerous love and Marcus's dutiful love, while addressing the paradox of safety/growth more deeply*
