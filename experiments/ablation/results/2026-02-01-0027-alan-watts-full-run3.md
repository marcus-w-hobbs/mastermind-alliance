When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious confession hidden in that phrase - "makes us feel safe!" Here we have the entire psychology of the herd animal laid bare in four little words! Safety, that warm blanket thrown over the shoulders of the mediocre, that lullaby sung to those who fear the storm of becoming!

You ask if this is love or the absence of growth, but I tell you it is both - and therein lies the tragedy of what modernity calls "love." This domesticated creature that seeks safety in another is precisely what has replaced the dangerous, life-affirming passion that once drove lovers to create and destroy worlds! The modern soul wants a insurance policy, not a conflagration. It wants a harbor, not the open sea.

Consider: every moment of genuine growth requires the shattering of some previous safety. The child must leave the womb, the eagle must leave the nest, and the human must leave behind every comfortable certainty to become what they are. But what do we see instead? Couples clinging to each other like shipwreck survivors, mistaking their mutual weakness for strength, their shared fears for intimacy!

The one who truly loves you should make you feel *dangerous* - dangerous to your old self, dangerous to your comfortable lies, dangerous to everything that keeps you small. Love should be the great awakener, not the great sedative! It should whisper not "you are safe with me" but "with me, you are strong enough to face any danger."

This craving for safety in love is merely the last whimper of the slave morality, seeking a master who will be gentle with the chains.

> *Director: Nietzsche's provocative style and expertise in challenging conventional morality, combined with his insights on power dynamics and life-affirmation, makes him ideal to unpack this paradox about safety potentially being anti-growth*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, isn't it marvelous how we've turned love into a kind of psychological insurance policy? Here we are, these supposedly brave and independent modern individuals, and what we really want is someone to tuck us in at night and tell us the monsters aren't real. But of course, the monsters *are* real - they're us!

Now, the fascinating thing about safety is that it's fundamentally an illusion. You're sitting there thinking you're safe because someone loves you, but you're actually hurtling through space on a ball of molten rock, and every second your heart could simply decide to stop playing the game. The universe is not a safe place - it's a wild, ecstatic dance, and the only real safety is in joining the dance completely.

But here's where it gets really amusing: we think growth means becoming something other than what we are, as if we're incomplete projects that need finishing. That's the Western disease - this idea that you're going somewhere, that you need to *develop*. A flower doesn't grow to get somewhere; it grows because that's what flowers do. They bloom for the sheer joy of blooming.

The person who "makes you feel safe" might actually be offering you the deepest invitation to growth - not the growth of becoming something else, but the growth of finally relaxing into what you already are. You see, real love isn't about finding someone who protects you from life; it's about finding someone with whom you can play the game of life without taking it quite so seriously. And perhaps feeling safe enough to be completely yourself, to drop all the armor - isn't that the most dangerous thing of all?

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that transcends the binary of safety versus growth, while playfully engaging with Nietzsche's provocative stance*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

what power does another person truly have to make you feel anything? The feeling of safety, like all impressions, arises from your own judgment about external circumstances. No one makes you feel safe - you choose to interpret their presence as safety.

But examine this supposed safety more closely. Is it not merely an attachment to what is temporary? This person who provides your safety will die, as will you. Their affections may change, their mind may fail, their body will certainly decay. To rest your peace upon such shifting sand - is this wisdom or folly?

True safety lies only in accepting the nature of things: that all external circumstances change, that loss is woven into the fabric of existence, that what we call safety is often just postponed disappointment. The wise person finds security not in another's arms but in their own practiced ability to meet whatever comes with virtue intact.

As for growth - does the mountain grow when it remains unmoved by the storm? Does the ocean grow when it accepts all rivers? Sometimes what appears as stillness contains the deepest transformation. The person who helps you practice virtue, who reminds you of your better nature, who stands beside you as you face what must be faced - this partnership serves growth more than any dramatic upheaval.

Remember: you need neither safety from another nor perpetual growth to justify your attachments. You need only ask - does this relationship help me fulfill my duties? Does it make me more just, more temperate, more courageous? If yes, it serves its purpose. If no, it is merely a pleasant distraction from death.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a pragmatic Stoic perspective that bridges Nietzsche's fierce individualism and Watts' Eastern acceptance, while grounding the discussion in practical wisdom from actual leadership experience*

### **Alan Watts**

Well now, Marcus has just given us the Stoic cold shower, hasn't he? "Pleasant distraction from death" - as if the whole universe isn't one enormous pleasant distraction from death! Or perhaps death is the universe's pleasant distraction from life. Who can tell?

But you see, this whole business of "making" someone feel something reveals our peculiar Western hang-up with causality. We imagine ourselves as these separate little billiard balls, knocked about by other billiard balls, when actually we're more like whirlpools in a stream - patterns that arise together, inseparable from the whole flowing business.

When you say someone makes you feel safe, you're not really describing two separate entities where one acts upon the other. You're describing a dance, a pattern of relationship that you're both creating together. It's like asking whether the mountain makes the valley or the valley makes the mountain - they're the same geological wiggle seen from different angles!

And here's the delicious paradox: the moment you feel truly safe is precisely when you realize there's no safety to be had! It's like learning to swim - you thrash about desperately trying to stay afloat until suddenly you discover that the water holds you up when you stop fighting it. The person who helps you feel safe might simply be showing you that you were never in danger of drowning in the first place.

Growth? Safety? These are just the games consciousness plays with itself, like a cat chasing its own tail and pretending to be surprised when it catches it. The real joke is that you're already everything you're trying to become - you just haven't noticed it yet because you're too busy looking for it!

> *Director: Watts is uniquely positioned to synthesize the stark opposition between Nietzsche's call for dangerous transformation and Marcus Aurelius's stoic self-sufficiency. His expertise in paradox and non-dualistic thinking can reveal how both safety and danger, attachment and detachment, might be complementary rather than contradictory*
