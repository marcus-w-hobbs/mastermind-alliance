Why does authentic assertion feel like risking death when it's actually the beginning of life?

---

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Look at the soul that shrinks from speaking truth—it has already died a thousand times in silence. What you call "risking death" is merely the fear of other men's opinions, which are themselves as fleeting as morning mist. These opinions cannot touch what is essential in you.

The authentic assertion you speak of—this is nothing more than aligning your words with reason and nature. When you suppress this, you act against your own rational faculty, which is the divine spark within. That suppression, that constant compromise with falsehood or half-truth, this is the true death. You become a walking corpse, animated by others' expectations rather than your own governing principle.

Consider the seed that remains buried, afraid to break through soil. It preserves itself, yes, but never becomes what it was meant to be. The moment of breaking through feels like destruction because something must give way—the comfortable darkness, the shell of safety. Yet this is precisely when life begins.

What do you actually risk? Disapproval? The loss of false friends? A reputation built on pretense? These are already worthless. You cannot lose what has no real substance.

The beginning of life comes when you stop dying incrementally through silence and cowardice. Speak what is true and necessary. Let the consequences fall where they may. This is not recklessness—it is finally being alive according to nature, which is the only life worth the name.

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but you see, there's a delicious paradox hiding in this whole business of "authentic assertion." The very idea that *you* must risk something to be *yourself* rather gives the game away, doesn't it? It suggests there are two of you—the real one cowering inside, and the false one strutting about in the social marketplace. But which one is getting up in the morning and brushing its teeth?

The feeling of risking death when you speak authentically is actually the ego catching a glimpse of its own transparency. Because what you call "I" is largely a social convention, a dance of agreements about who you're supposed to be. When you speak authentically, you're threatening to pull back the curtain on this elaborate puppet show. The ego experiences this as death because, well, it rather is—the death of a fiction.

But here's the cosmic joke: there's nothing behind the curtain but more curtains! The "authentic self" you're trying to express is just as much a performance as the false one. Life isn't something that begins after you've finally gotten yourself sorted out and speaking truly. Life is already happening—it's this whole marvelous mess of hesitation, assertion, fear, and courage all at once.

When a wave rises from the ocean, does it risk death by asserting its waveness? Or is it simply doing what the ocean does at that particular point? The feeling of risk comes from imagining yourself as separate from the whole dance. But you're not asserting *against* life—you're how life asserts itself right here, anxiety and all.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what sweet poison you both serve! Marcus with his stoic resignation dressed as virtue, Watts with his Oriental dissolution of all tension into cosmic giggling. But let me tell you what you *fear* to acknowledge—that this "risk of death" you speak of is precisely what separates the living from the already-decomposing!

You ask why authentic assertion feels like risking death? Because it *is* a kind of death—the death of everything small and herd-like in you! Every time you speak what you truly value, you murder the cozy little fiction that you are like everyone else, that you share their petty moralities, their comfortable lies, their agreement to call weakness "virtue" and fear "prudence."

Marcus speaks of "aligning with reason and nature"—as if nature were reasonable! As if the lion consulted universal principles before devouring the lamb! No—authentic assertion feels like death because you are finally *dangerous*, finally *alive* in a way that makes the herd nervous. They sense, these last men blinking and asking "what is love, what is creation?"—they sense that you have broken their most sacred contract: the agreement to remain small together.

And Watts—this clever dismissal of the ego as mere illusion! How convenient for those who lack the strength to *have* an ego worth defending! Yes, the self is a creation—*therefore create magnificently!* The authentic assertion is not the unmasking of some pre-existing truth but the *forging* of new values in the furnace of your own will!

You risk death because you risk *mattering*. How terrifying for the mediocre!

### **Marcus Aurelius**

You mistake my meaning, Nietzsche, and in your eagerness to demolish what you imagine as weakness, you've erected something far more fragile—a self that requires constant assertion to exist at all. This is not strength but exhausting vanity.

When I speak of aligning with reason and nature, I do not mean nature is "reasonable" in your sense—tame and domesticated. I mean that you, like the lion, have a nature. The lion does not *struggle* to be a lion. It does not wake each morning and forge its lion-ness through magnificent acts of will. It simply is what it is, and acts accordingly. The authentic assertion I speak of is this same directness—not the anxious performance you describe, where one must constantly prove oneself dangerous and alive to an audience.

Your "forging of new values" still chains you to the opinions of the herd you claim to transcend. Why else speak of making them nervous, of being dangerous *to them*? You remain their prisoner, defined by opposition. True freedom lies in indifference to whether they approve or cower.

The risk of death is real, yes—but not because we become "dangerous" or "matter" to others. It is real because we finally stop betraying the rational principle within us, which requires neither audience nor applause. When I say what is true and necessary, I do not do it to distinguish myself from the herd or to forge magnificent new values. I do it because my nature as a rational being demands it, just as the vine produces grapes.

This is not resignation. It is the only genuine power—acting from what you are, not from what you wish others to see.
