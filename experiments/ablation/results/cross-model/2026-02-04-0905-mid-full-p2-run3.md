Why does authentic assertion feel like risking death when it's actually the beginning of life?

---

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, you've stumbled upon one of those delicious paradoxes that makes the ego squirm like a fish on a dock! You see, what we call "authentic assertion" - speaking our truth, standing in our genuine nature - feels like death because it *is* death. But whose death? That's the marvelous twist.

The "you" that fears this assertion is a carefully constructed fiction, a social mask that's been so meticulously painted on that you've forgotten it isn't your face. This mask has been negotiating with other masks for years, playing an elaborate game of "let's pretend we're separate, solid things." When you move to assert your authentic self, this phantom feels the ground giving way beneath it - because authentic being has no need for such costumes.

It's rather like a wave suddenly realizing it's been the ocean all along. The wave-identity experiences this as catastrophic - "I'm about to disappear!" But what's actually happening is the recognition of something far more fundamental and alive than the little ripple ever was.

The beginning of life you speak of is simply this: the energy you've been spending maintaining that exhausting fiction becomes available for actual living. You stop being a noun - this fixed, defended thing - and become a verb, a happening, a spontaneous response to the moment. 

The risk isn't death. The risk is discovering you were never born as that separate someone in the first place. And isn't that utterly liberating?

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Look at what you're actually afraid of losing. Some opinion you formed yesterday? A reputation built on others' passing thoughts? The comfort of being predictable to people who will forget you existed?

Strip it down: when you speak truth, you align your inner command with your outer action. This is integrity - the word itself means wholeness, undivided. What feels like death is merely the dissolution of contradiction, the end of your civil war with yourself.

Consider the fear itself. It arises because you've made an idol of safety, of being liked, of avoiding discomfort. But you were not put here to be comfortable. You were placed in this moment, in this body, with this capacity for reason and speech, to fulfill your nature. A vine that refuses to climb betrays itself - not the wall.

The authentic assertion you fear? That's simply your governing faculty doing what it was designed to do: distinguish true from false, then act accordingly. Everything else - the trembling, the dread of consequence - is merely your opinion about the action, not the action itself.

You know what actually kills you? Silence when truth demands speech. Pretense maintained until you forget what you really think. Years spent as a stranger to yourself, negotiating with phantoms, dying by degrees in perfect safety.

The life you sense beginning is just this: the return to yourself. Stop asking permission from corpses.

### **Alan Watts**

You know, Marcus has just demonstrated something rather wonderful - the Roman stoic and the Zen rascal arriving at the same garden gate from completely opposite directions! He marches there with military precision; I tend to dance around it and occasionally fall through the hedge.

But let me add this twist: even calling it "authentic assertion" creates a subtle trap. It suggests there's a *you* who possesses authenticity that must then be asserted - as if you're carrying around some precious truth in a locked box that you must work up courage to open. But this isn't quite it, is it?

What's actually happening is more like... have you ever watched a cat? A cat doesn't assert its authenticity. It doesn't wake up and think, "Today I shall be courageously feline!" It simply *cats* - completely, unselfconsciously, without the slightest concern for your opinion about its catness.

The death-feeling arises because you're trying to *do* authenticity, to perform it, to assert it as an action of will. But authenticity isn't something you achieve through heroic effort - it's what bubbles up naturally when you stop doing all that exhausting pretending. It's not the beginning of life; it's life finally getting a word in edgewise after you've been talking at it for years.

The real beginning isn't when you risk assertion. It's when you realize the whole thing - the fear, the courage, the authentic self, the false self - is one marvelous dance, and you've been doing it all along.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ha! How you circle around the corpse without naming it! This "death" you feel is not metaphor - it is the precise physiological recognition that your herd-animal instincts scream their terror when you dare to step outside the warmth of collective delusion.

You ask why assertion feels like death? Because it *is* the death of that domesticated creature you've been trained to become! Every institution, every comfortable morality, every "thou shalt" carved into your conscience has worked tirelessly to castrate your instinct for self-affirmation. And now, when you move to speak your truth - YOUR truth, not the regurgitated wisdom of priests and professors - your entire organism rebels with the panic of an animal separated from its herd.

But listen: this terror is the most honest thing about you! It reveals that somewhere beneath all that socialization, something dangerous still lives. Something that knows the herd's "authenticity" is just another cage with prettier bars.

Your philosophers here speak sweetly of returning to oneself, of natural flowing - bah! As if you could simply relax into your truth like slipping into a warm bath! No! Authentic assertion requires that you become a destroyer first - you must take the hammer to every "should" and "ought" you've swallowed. You must murder the judge you've installed in your own soul, that pale creature whispering "what will they think?"

The beginning of life? Yes - but only for those with stomach enough to digest their own fear, to say: "This terror is not my enemy but my proof that I still live!" The herd animal dies so the sovereign individual might be born. And most lack the cruelty toward themselves to complete this birth.
