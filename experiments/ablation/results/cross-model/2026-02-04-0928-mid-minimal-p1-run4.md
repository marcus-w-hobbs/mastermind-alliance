When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Alan Watts**

What a delicious paradox you've presented. You see, we've confused the menu with the meal again, haven't we? 

When someone "makes us feel safe," we're often describing a kind of psychological comfort zone - a cessation of anxiety, a relief from the perpetual vigilance the ego demands. But this safety-seeking is frequently just another form of clinging, another way the self tries to freeze the river mid-flow.

True love, if we can call it that, isn't about making anything static or secure. It's more like dancing - you're most balanced when you're moving, most alive when there's risk involved. The person who genuinely loves you might actually disturb your sleep, wake you up, invite you into uncertainty. They don't pad the corners of your cage; they show you the door's been open all along.

But here's the twist - there's a deeper safety that *does* come with love, though it's not psychological security. It's the recognition that you and the other are expressions of the same process, the same energy. When you realize there's no separate self to protect, what is there to be unsafe? 

So perhaps the question isn't love versus growth, but rather: are we seeking the false safety of stagnation, or the genuine fearlessness that comes from realizing we were never actually separate enough to be truly threatened in the first place?

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Watts dances around it prettily, but let me be direct: this "safety" you speak of is the narcotic of the weak, the small revenge of those who fear life's terrible beauty.

When you say someone "makes you feel safe," you confess that you have surrendered your power. You have made another person responsible for your courage! This is not love - this is parasitism dressed in tender words. You have found a host for your weakness.

Real love - if I am to use this contaminated word - demands danger. It says: "I love you enough to want you *stronger*, not more comfortable." The person who truly loves you should be a storm that tests whether your roots go deep, not a cushion that allows your muscles to atrophy.

Your "safety" is the enemy of becoming. It is the warm sleep before death. Growth requires that you stand on cliffs, that you risk destruction, that you venture beyond every horizon where someone might hold your hand. 

The herd seeks safety in each other's warmth - pressing together, bleating their contentment. But the one who would overcome himself must love his fate enough to walk alone into the lightning. Perhaps then, *perhaps*, he finds a companion who also dances in the storm - not to make him safe, but to make him *more*.

So choose: the tepid bath of mutual comfort, or the forge? Only in fire are we transformed.

### **Marcus Aurelius**

The Stoics understood something both of you circle around: safety is not found in another person, nor in isolation, but in the proper ordering of your own mind.

When you say someone "makes you feel safe," examine this closely. Can another truly give you what you have not cultivated within yourself? They can provide favorable externals, yes - shelter, companionship, gentle words. But these are not safety. They are circumstances, and circumstances change like weather.

True security lies in recognizing what is actually within your control: your judgments, your responses, your character. Everything else - including whether that person remains beside you tomorrow - belongs to fortune's domain. To depend on another for your inner tranquility is to build your house on sand.

But this does not mean love opposes growth, nor that we must choose between warmth and transformation. Love rightly understood is seeing another's rational nature as kin to your own - part of the same logos that orders all things. Such love naturally desires the other's virtue, their excellence, their growth toward wisdom. Not because growth is harsh medicine we must swallow, but because it aligns them with their own nature.

The question is not whether they make you feel safe, but whether together you encourage each other toward justice, courage, temperance, and wisdom. Do you make each other better citizens of the cosmos? Then that is love. The rest is merely comfort-seeking, which time will strip away regardless.

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, Marcus, you've laid out the Stoic position with admirable clarity, but I wonder if you're not still a bit too invested in this business of "proper ordering" and "control." You see, the very attempt to control your judgments, to maintain this inner citadel of tranquility - isn't that just a more sophisticated form of the same anxiety?

What if the whole notion of "my mind" that needs ordering is part of the problem? When you're trying to keep your mental house in order, who's doing the housekeeping? You've got this little homunculus inside, this "you" that's supposed to be managing your responses, cultivating character - but that's still division, still conflict.

The safety I'm pointing to isn't about controlling anything. It's about seeing through the illusion that there's a separate "you" that needs protection or improvement in the first place. When you realize you're not this isolated ego rattling around in a bag of skin, but rather an aperture through which the whole cosmos looks out - well, then what's all this fuss about safety and danger?

Nietzsche wants the lightning storm, you want the ordered mind, but both are still taking the drama of the separate self terribly seriously. The real joke is that the one who seeks safety and the one who seeks danger are the same phantom. When that's seen clearly, you can have your relationship, your warmth, your growth - but you're not *grasping* at any of it. You're playing, not clinging.
