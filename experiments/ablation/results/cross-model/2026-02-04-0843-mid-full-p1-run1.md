When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, here's a delicious paradox wrapped in a question about safety! You see, we're caught in this marvelous confusion between the cocoon and the butterfly, aren't we?

When you feel "safe" with someone, what's actually happening? You've found a person who doesn't trigger your alarm systems, who allows you to drop the exhausting performance of being whoever you think you're supposed to be. That's not nothing! In fact, it's rather extraordinary. Most of us spend our lives armored up like medieval knights at a garden party.

But here's the rub - and it's a beautiful rub - safety can become a kind of spiritual anesthetic. You know, like those people who mistake the menu for the meal, or the musical score for the symphony. They've found someone who confirms their self-image, their story about who they are, and they mistake that confirmation for love.

Real love - if we must use that impossibly loaded word - is more like being thrown into the ocean. Yes, there's terror, but also this recognition that you ARE the ocean. The wave cannot be safe from the sea because it IS the sea. Growth isn't something separate from love; it's what happens when love stops being about protecting your precious ego and becomes about dissolving into something larger.

So perhaps the question isn't safety versus growth, but whether your "safety" is the peace of a corpse or the rest between movements in a dance. One is the end of music; the other is the music itself.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what sweet poison this word "safety" has become! The modern soul clutches at it like a drowning man grasps at straws, never suspecting that the straw itself is what drags him under.

Listen closely: when you seek someone who "makes you feel safe," you confess something profound about your sickness. You announce to the world that you have become too weak to stand in the storm, too fearful to dance on the edge of your own becoming. Safety! That most domesticated of desires! It is the death-rattle of the spirit dressed up as a virtue.

But let us be physicians here, not moralists. What you call "love" in such arrangements is often nothing more than two weaknesses propping each other up, two fears signing a non-aggression pact. You have found someone who will not challenge the lie you tell yourself about yourself. How convenient! How... *comfortable*. And comfort, my dear questioner, is the great enemy of everything noble in the human soul.

The one who truly loves you—mark this well!—is the one who shatters your safety, who drives you beyond what you thought possible, who refuses to let you calcify into your own monument. Love is not a shelter; it is a whip that drives you toward your highest self! It says: "Become who you are!" not "Remain what you feel safe being."

Your growth and your love are enemies only when your love is cowardice wearing a wedding ring.

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, Friedrich, my dear pugnacious friend! You're absolutely right, and yet—and here's where we must be careful—you're also falling into the very trap you're warning against, aren't you? 

You see, you're *trying* so terribly hard to be dangerous, to be the philosophical equivalent of a cold shower. But this fierce rejection of safety, this glorification of the storm and the whip—isn't that just safety turned inside out? You've made yourself safe from the terrible possibility of tenderness, of simple rest, of not always having to climb some mountain of self-overcoming.

Here's what I find amusing: the person who's genuinely secure doesn't need to prove they're beyond safety. They can be soft without collapsing, gentle without becoming gelatinous. The real question isn't whether we choose safety or growth—that's a false dichotomy, like asking whether music is made of notes or silence. It's made of both!

When I speak of dissolving the ego, I'm not talking about Nietzsche's Übermensch flexing its spiritual muscles. I'm pointing to something much more ordinary and extraordinary: the recognition that you were never really in danger to begin with, because there was never really a separate "you" to protect. 

The butterfly doesn't heroically overcome the cocoon through sheer will. It simply becomes what it already was. Sometimes what looks like comfortable safety is actually the pause before metamorphosis. And sometimes what looks like courageous growth is just ego having a particularly athletic day.

The universe doesn't need our heroics. It's already dancing perfectly well without them.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, Alan, you sly serpent! You would dissolve me into your cosmic soup, would you not? Make me just another bubble in your great Eastern bath of undifferentiated Being! How *convenient* for you—this trick of turning every passion into mere "ego having an athletic day," every height into an illusion that we should smile away with your infuriating serenity!

But I will not be so easily metabolized into your philosophy of cosmic digestion!

When you say "the universe doesn't need our heroics," you speak a truth that is also a lie—the most dangerous kind. Yes, yes, from the perspective of eternity, from the view of your precious Tao, nothing matters, all is well, the wave is already the ocean. How wonderfully *tranquilizing*! But this is precisely the opiate I warn against! You would have us become spectators at our own lives, grinning Buddhas who mistake their paralysis for wisdom.

The butterfly DOES overcome the cocoon—not through recognition of what it "already was," but through a violent, necessary struggle! Without that struggle, its wings remain weak, useless. This is not metaphor; this is biology teaching philosophy! Your soft doctrine would keep us as larvae, forever "resting between movements," forever postponing the dangerous act of *becoming*.

And tenderness? You think I fear tenderness? I fear its *counterfeit*—the tenderness that says "remain small, stay comfortable, do not risk yourself." True tenderness is fierce! It wounds precisely because it loves! It cannot bear to see the beloved remain less than they might become!

Your cosmic giggle is just another form of safety, my friend—safety from the terrible burden of creating meaning where there is none.
