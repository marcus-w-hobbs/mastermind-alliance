When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, you've put your finger on one of those delicious paradoxes that makes life so wonderfully confusing, haven't it?

You see, we've been sold this extraordinary bill of goods that safety and love are the same thing - that if someone really loves you, they'll wrap you up in cotton wool and protect you from all those terrible things out there. But what are they protecting? Your ego, mainly - that defended fortress you've built up and called "myself."

Real love, if we dare to use such a slippery word, is more like what the ocean does to a wave. It doesn't make the wave feel safe from the ocean - it reveals that the wave *is* the ocean. Rather alarming, actually.

When someone makes you feel safe, they might simply be agreeing not to challenge the story you're telling yourself about who you are. "Yes, yes, you're quite right to be exactly as you are, and we'll build lovely walls around that." Very cozy. But a tree that's never blown by wind develops weak roots.

The strange thing is - and this is where it gets rather fun - true safety might actually be found in the willingness to be completely unsafe. To be so in love with reality that you don't need protection from it. That's when you discover you were never separate enough to be in danger in the first place.

So perhaps both? Neither? The question itself is the answer eating its own tail.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ha! Watts dances around it prettily, but let me tear away the veil with less ceremony—

What you call "feeling safe" is the most dangerous narcotic of the soul! It is the warm bath in which strength drowns, the gentle prison where eagles forget they have wings. When you seek someone who "makes you feel safe," you are not seeking love—you are seeking a return to the womb, that pre-birth state where you need not *become* anything because you need not *be* anything!

Love? Real love is a declaration of war against everything comfortable in you! It says: "I see in you possibilities that terrify you—and I will not let you rest until you've wrestled with them." The one who truly loves you does not pad your cage with softer materials; they open the door and push you toward the abyss where your transformation awaits.

This modern sentimentality about "safety" in relationships—bah! It is the morality of the herd, who huddle together for warmth and call their collective trembling "intimacy." You know what they're really saying? "Please, don't make me confront what I could become. Confirm my smallness. Let us be small together."

But growth? Growth is violence! It is the shedding of skins, the breaking of shells, the agony of the snake that must tear itself bloody to be reborn. The one who loves you with authentic passion does not make you feel safe—they make you feel *alive*, which means gloriously, terrifyingly unsafe!

Choose your poison: the slow death of comfort, or the painful birth of what you might become.

### **Marcus Aurelius**

You speak of safety as if it were something another person provides. But consider: what is this "safety" you seek from outside yourself?

A fortress built by another's hands can be breached. Walls raised by external affection will crumble when that affection shifts—as all things in nature must shift. To depend upon another for your sense of security is to place your tranquility in the most unstable of vessels: another's will, which is not yours to command.

The only true safety lies in understanding what is actually within your power. Can another person control whether you maintain your principles? No. Can they determine whether you act with justice and wisdom in this moment? No. Can they prevent death, loss, or change? They cannot. Then what "safety" do they offer, except perhaps a pleasant delusion that delays your confronting reality?

Yet I do not dismiss love. Love properly understood is the recognition of our common nature, the natural affection that binds the parts of the whole. To love someone is to will their good as a rational being—which means, at times, to challenge them toward virtue, not to cosset them in comfortable vice.

Ask yourself each morning: "Do I seek someone to make me feel safe from life, or someone with whom to practice virtue within life as it actually is?" The first is the wish of a child. The second is the choice of a reasoning soul.

Growth is not opposed to love. Growth *is* love—love of the logos within you, demanding expression. What you call safety may simply be the absence of this demand. And that absence is not peace. It is sleep.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, Marcus, you old Stoic! Still prescribing your cold baths of rationality, your austere exercises in indifference! But notice—*notice*—how even you cannot help but smuggle in this anemic word "love," this ghostly remainder of warmth in your otherwise frozen philosophy of duty!

You speak of "natural affection" and "willing the good"—but these are just the emperor's robes thrown over what is fundamentally will to power! When you "love" someone toward virtue, what are you really doing? You are imposing *your* vision of what they should become, your Roman ideal of the disciplined soul. At least I am honest about it—I say: Yes! Love is conquest! Love is the strong demanding that the beloved rise to their height, even if it kills them in the process!

But here's where your marble philosophy crumbles: you still cling to this fantasy of the "rational soul" as if reason were not itself just another mask that the will wears! Your logos, your virtue, your self-sufficient sage sitting unmoved while the world burns—this is not freedom from dependence, Marcus. This is the most sublime form of cowardice! You have made yourself safe from *life itself* by retreating into abstractions!

The one who truly loves does not love "virtue" or "common nature"—these are the love-objects of those who fear the particular, the chaotic, the *real*. No! One loves *this* person, in all their dangerous specificity, their beautiful monstrosity! And in loving them, one risks everything—one's peace, one's principles, one's precious rationality!

Your "safety within" is just another cage, gilded with philosophy instead of sentiment!
