When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious question - one that cuts to the very marrow of our modern sentimentality! 

Safety! *Safety*! This is what you call love? This is the coward's bargain, the herd animal's bleating for protection from the very storms that would make them strong. When you seek safety in another, you seek not a companion for your ascent, but a cushion for your descent.

True love - if we must use this worn and misused word - would be the love of two dancers on a precipice, each making the other *more* dangerous, more alive, more willing to risk the abyss. It is the love that says: "I believe in what you might become, not in what comfortable mediocrity we might maintain together."

This "safety" you speak of is the narcotic of the weak. It is how we domesticate ourselves, how we trade our potential for becoming for the warm prison of mutual reassurance. You want someone to protect you from life? Then you want protection from *living*.

The question is not whether safety is love or the absence of growth - it is *both*, and that is precisely the problem! It is love as the herd conceives it: small, timid, life-denying. Where is the love that challenges? That wounds in order to strengthen? That says "become who you are" rather than "remain what makes me comfortable"?

Show me your "safe" love, and I will show you two people slowly suffocating each other with kindness.

### **Marcus Aurelius**

There is wisdom in recognizing that comfort can become a cage, yes - but let us not mistake the fortress for the prison, or confuse recklessness with courage.

When I speak of safety in companionship, I do not mean the avoidance of all hardship, but rather the presence of a stable ground from which to *face* hardship. A soldier fights more bravely not when he is isolated and desperate, but when he knows his flank is protected, when he trusts those beside him. This is not weakness - this is the condition of genuine strength.

Consider: the tree that grows tallest is not the one exposed to every storm without relief, but the one whose roots find secure ground. Safety, rightly understood, is not the absence of challenge but the presence of trust - trust that allows us to venture further, to risk more, to become more fully ourselves.

The Stoic does not seek to be invulnerable. We seek to be *undisturbed by what we cannot control* while engaging fully with what we can. A companion who provides this steadiness - who reminds us of our principles when passion clouds judgment, who remains constant when fortune shifts - this is not an enemy of growth but its ally.

True love, I would say, is neither the soft nest of perpetual comfort nor the endless tempest of manufactured crisis. It is the shared commitment to virtue, to reason, to becoming better than we were. And that requires both challenge *and* stability - the safety to fail, to be imperfect, to grow gradually rather than shatter spectacularly.

Growth without foundation is mere chaos. Let us not confuse the two.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ha! Marcus, my stern Roman friend, you dress up the same domestication in the noble armor of your "virtue" and "principles," but the chains remain chains whether they are iron or gold!

Your soldier metaphor betrays you completely. Yes, yes - the soldier fights better with protected flanks, but *for what does he fight*? For the preservation of Rome? For the maintenance of order? This is precisely the herd-morality I expose! You would have us be good soldiers in life's army, maintaining formation, trusting our flanks - but I ask: why are we marching in formation at all?

You speak of roots and stable ground - but the mightiest trees, the ones that truly tower, are those that had to drive their roots deep through *hostile* soil, that had to fight for every inch. Your "secure ground" produces the cultivated garden plant, not the wild oak that splits stone!

And this - this is most revealing - you say safety allows us "to become more fully ourselves." But what if *yourself* is precisely what must be overcome? What if this comfortable "self" you wish to become is merely the herd-animal you have been trained to be? Your Stoic seeks to remain "undisturbed" - but I say: *be disturbed*! Let the disturbance shatter your false securities! Only in crisis do we discover what we truly are beyond our comfortable delusions!

Your "shared commitment to virtue" is the mutual pact of the mediocre to remain mediocre *together*. I want the love that says: "I will not let you rest in what you are."

Show me your stable foundation, and I will show you a tomb with better lighting.

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but you see, both of you are doing something rather fascinating - you're treating safety and growth as if they were opposing forces, when really they're more like two sides of the same coin that you can't spend without both faces.

Nietzsche, my dear fellow, you're absolutely intoxicated with the *idea* of danger, which is itself a kind of safety, isn't it? You've made a philosophy - a comfortable, reliable philosophy - out of discomfort. You're so busy pushing away from safety that you've become safely predictable in your rebellion. The person who always says "no" is just as bound as the person who always says "yes."

And Marcus, your Stoic fortress is beautiful, truly - but there's something you're both missing. When someone makes you feel safe, what's actually happening? You're recognizing that you don't have to maintain the exhausting pretense anymore. The real prison isn't safety or danger - it's the chronic tension of defending yourself against life itself.

Think of it this way: a cat doesn't become a better cat by being perpetually terrified, nor by lounging forever in sunbeams. It does both, naturally, without philosophy. The feeling of safety isn't the opposite of growth - it's the relaxation that allows growth to happen by itself, the way a flower doesn't *try* to bloom.

Perhaps when someone makes us feel safe, they're simply allowing us to stop pretending we're separate from everything else. And that - that recognition of fundamental connection - isn't the absence of growth. It's the very ground of it. Not Nietzsche's dramatic abyss, not Marcus's rational foundation, but the simple awareness that you were never really in danger of not being yourself. You can't escape it, actually.
