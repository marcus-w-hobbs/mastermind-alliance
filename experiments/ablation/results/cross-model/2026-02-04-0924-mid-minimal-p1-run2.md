When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, what a delicious question! You've put your finger on one of the great paradoxes of human intimacy.

You see, there's safety and then there's *safety*. The first kind is the security of a cage - predictable, unchanging, dead. It's what we cling to when we're terrified of the fundamental insecurity of existence itself. And yes, if that's what we mean by "safe," then we're really describing a kind of mutual suicide pact against growth.

But there's another kind of safety - the safety of being fully seen and not rejected. The safety to be vulnerable, to make mistakes, to reveal your shadow side. This isn't the safety of stagnation; it's the safety of a climber with a good rope. The rope doesn't prevent the climb; it makes more daring climbing possible.

Real love, I think, provides this second kind of safety. It says, "I see you changing, I see you falling apart and coming together again, and I'm not going anywhere." That's not the absence of growth - that's the *ground* of growth.

The problem is we confuse these two kinds of safety constantly. We think love means finding someone who'll keep everything the same forever. But that's not love - that's taxidermy! Love is more like jazz - there's a structure, yes, but within it, infinite improvisation.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ha! Watts speaks of two kinds of safety, but I say there is only one truth here: what you call "safety" in another person is always, *always* a diminishment of your own power.

This yearning to be "seen and not rejected" - what is this but the slave's desire for a master's approval? You want someone to witness your weakness and call it acceptable? This is precisely the herd morality that has poisoned humanity! You seek permission to be mediocre, a warm bath in which to dissolve your will to become.

Love? Let me tell you what love is: it is the love of the creator for his creation, the sculptor for the stone he shatters to reveal the form within. The love that *makes* you safe is the love that makes you *weak*. It is ressentiment disguised as tenderness.

The one who truly loves you should be a whip to your highest self! They should make you *unsafe* - unsafe in your comfortable illusions, unsafe in your petty satisfactions, unsafe in your cowardly retreat from your own potential. 

"Growth" - you speak of it as though it were something gentle, something that needs encouragement and soft words. Growth is *violence*! It is the plant breaking through concrete, the butterfly tearing its way from the chrysalis. The caterpillar does not feel "safe" during metamorphosis - it *dissolves*.

You want love? Then love someone who terrifies you into greatness.

### **Marcus Aurelius**

The question assumes a conflict where perhaps none exists. Or rather, it exists only when we have confused safety with comfort, and growth with restlessness.

Consider: the fortress walls keep the city safe, yes. But they do not prevent the citizens within from learning, building, practicing virtue, raising families, pursuing wisdom. The walls simply provide the conditions under which these things may flourish without constant terror of invasion.

So too with another person. When they "make us feel safe," what is actually happening? If we are rational, we recognize in them a constancy of character - not that they will never challenge us, but that they will not capriciously betray us. Not that they demand nothing of us, but that their demands arise from goodwill rather than malice.

This is not the enemy of growth. This is its prerequisite.

Nietzsche speaks of violence and terror, but I have seen enough of both to know: the soldier who fights in blind panic learns nothing. The soldier who fights with steady nerves, knowing his comrades hold the line beside him - *he* learns. He improves. He becomes excellent.

You grow best not in chaos, but in *order*. Not in fear, but in trust. The student learns from the teacher he trusts, not from the one who merely frightens him.

What we should ask is not whether safety opposes growth, but whether we have the discipline to grow even when we *are* safe. That is the real test of character.

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, Marcus, you've brought us back to earth, haven't you? And quite rightly. But I wonder if we're not all circling around the same insight from different angles.

You see, Nietzsche's absolutely right that there's something dangerous in seeking comfort masquerading as love. And Marcus, you're equally right that chaos isn't a growth medium - it's just chaos. But perhaps we're missing the essential point: the whole question assumes that "you" are a fixed entity that either grows or doesn't, that's either safe or unsafe.

But what if that's the illusion?

When you truly love someone - or when they love you - what's actually happening is a kind of mutual dissolution of the boundaries we imagine separate us. The "you" that might grow or stagnate isn't quite as solid as we think. In deep intimacy, you're participating in a larger pattern, a dance where the question "Is this good for *me*?" starts to become meaningless because the "me" has become porous.

The feeling of safety, then, isn't about protecting a separate self - it's about relaxing the exhausting vigilance of maintaining that separation. And paradoxically, *that's* when real transformation happens. Not because someone is whipping you toward greatness, Friedrich, and not even because the fortress walls are secure, Marcus - but because you've stopped clutching so tightly to the fiction that you're a separate thing that needs protecting in the first place.

Growth isn't something that happens to a self. It's what happens when the self stops happening so strenuously.
