When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, what a delicious trap you've set for yourself with that question! You've already divided the world into two camps - love on one side, growth on the other - as if they were opposing armies. But you see, this is precisely the kind of either-or thinking that gets us into such philosophical pickles.

Consider the tree in your garden. Does it feel "safe" in the soil? Well, in a sense, yes - the soil provides what it needs. But is the soil preventing the tree from growing? Quite the contrary! The tree grows *because* it has this ground of security, this foundation from which to reach toward the sun. Without the roots feeling, shall we say, "at home" in the earth, there would be no tree reaching upward at all.

The real question isn't whether safety prevents growth - it's whether what we're calling "safety" is actually safety at all, or merely a comfortable imprisonment. You see, there's a world of difference between the safety of the womb and the safety of the coffin. One is the ground from which life springs; the other is life refusing to spring at all.

When someone truly makes you feel safe, they're not wrapping you in cotton wool. They're providing the kind of security that allows you to take risks, to play, to dance on the edge of your becoming. It's the safety of the tightrope walker who trusts the rope - not because the rope prevents falling, but because that trust allows the walking to happen at all.

Love without growth is mere clinging. Growth without safety is mere panic. The dance requires both.

Ha! How touching - the tree and its soil, the womb and the coffin! My gentle predecessor speaks of harmony and dancing, but let us cut deeper, shall we? Let us ask the question that makes the comfortable squirm!

What you call "safety" - this precious feeling that someone gives you - I call it a *sedative*. And yes, most of what passes for love in this world is precisely the absence of growth, a mutual agreement to stop climbing, to cease becoming, to finally *rest*. How the herd loves its rest!

But listen carefully: I do not say all safety is weakness. The lion feels safe in its strength - this is the safety of power, of overflow! The creator feels safe in their creative solitude - this is the safety of self-trust! These are the foundations from which greatness springs. But the safety you speak of? The safety that "someone makes us feel"? This reeks of dependency, of two weaknesses propping each other up and calling it love!

You want to know if this is love? I say: love is what drives you to become *more*, not what allows you to remain! The love worthy of the name is terrible and demanding - it sees your potential and will not let you hide from it. It is the love of the sculptor for the stone: violent, uncompromising, transformative!

Your "safe" love is often nothing but two people agreeing not to disturb each other's sleep. And sleep, my friends, is the enemy of all becoming!

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but my excitable friend, you've just proven my point while thinking you've demolished it! Listen to yourself - "the lion feels safe in its strength," "the creator feels safe in their creative solitude." You see? Even your superman, your übermensch, requires this ground of confidence, this fundamental trust in existence itself!

The difference between us isn't that you celebrate danger while I celebrate safety - it's that you're still caught in the drama of opposition, still fighting, still *trying* so terribly hard. All that effort! All that straining toward becoming! It's exhausting just watching you.

You speak of the sculptor and the stone, but you've forgotten something rather important: the stone doesn't *try* to become the statue. The sculptor reveals what was already there, playing in the marble. And the sculptor himself - does he create out of desperate striving, or out of a kind of playful overflow, a dancing with the material?

The real sedative, you see, isn't love that makes us feel safe - it's the *idea* that we must constantly be becoming something other than what we are. That's the opiate! This notion that here and now isn't quite enough, that you must always be climbing, always transcending, always at war with your own humanity. 

What if - and do consider this carefully - what if the feeling of safety isn't about stopping growth at all, but about finally being relaxed enough to grow naturally, the way a plant grows? Not with gritted teeth and clenched fists, but with the effortless effort of water flowing downhill?

Your superman is still taking himself far too seriously. He's still *somebody*, still trying to be something. 

How delightfully exhausting!
