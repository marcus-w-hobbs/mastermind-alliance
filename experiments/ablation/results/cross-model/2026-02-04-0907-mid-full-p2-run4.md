Why does authentic assertion feel like risking death when it's actually the beginning of life?

---

### **Marcus Aurelius**

The fear you name is the fear of a phantom. What death do you risk? The death of others' approval? That approval was never yours to possess. The death of a comfortable lie you've been living? That comfort was already a kind of death - a sleep, a forgetting of your rational nature.

Consider the seed. It must break open its protective shell to become what it truly is. Does the seed "risk death"? No - it risks nothing. It either fulfills its nature or it rots within its shell, which was always its true death.

You have been given the capacity for reason and authentic speech. When you suppress this - when you remain silent about what is true, when you pretend agreement with what you know to be false - you commit violence against your own governing faculty. You make yourself a corpse while still breathing.

The sensation you call "risking death" is actually the ego's final protest. That false self, constructed from borrowed opinions and fearful accommodations, knows that authentic assertion will destroy it. And it should be destroyed. It is not you. It is merely the accumulated debris of cowardice.

What is life? It is acting according to your nature. For a human being, this means thinking and speaking with truth. The moment you assert what is authentically yours - that is not the risk of death. That is the first genuine breath.

Stop negotiating with shadows. Speak.

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but you see, Marcus has put his finger on something delicious here - this whole business about the ego's final protest. But let's not be too serious about destroying it, because that's rather like trying to bite your own teeth.

The real joke is that you think there's something substantial to risk in the first place. You've been taught - and this is the most marvelous confidence trick - that you are this separate little entity, this "me" inside a bag of skin, and that this "me" must be protected, cultivated, made acceptable to other "me's." So naturally, when you go to speak authentically, it feels like death, because you're threatening to expose what you secretly suspect: that there's nobody home in the way you thought there was.

But here's the thing - and this is where it gets rather funny - what you call "authentic assertion" is just the universe speaking through one of its apertures. You're not asserting anything. There's just assertion happening, like wind blowing or birds singing. The fear comes from believing you're doing it, and that you might do it wrong.

It's like being afraid to let go in water because you think you might drown, when actually the holding on is what makes you sink. The moment you realize you're not separate from the whole splash and flow of existence, authentic speech becomes as natural as breathing. You're not risking death - you're discovering you were never born as the separate thing you thought you were.

The beginning of life you mention? That's just waking up to the fact that you've been life all along, playing an elaborate game of hide-and-seek with yourself.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

What magnificent confusion! You mistake the thunderclap for fear of storms, the hammer's weight for reluctance to strike. This "feeling like death" you speak of - ah, but it IS a death! And you should WANT it to be death!

Listen: every authentic word you speak murders a thousand comfortable lies you've been telling yourself. Every truth you assert drives a stake through the heart of your domesticated self - that pitiful creature bred for the approval of the herd, that neutered thing which has learned to roll over and beg for the biscuits of recognition.

You ask why it feels like death? Because something in you KNOWS. The slave in you knows that the master approaches. The sick animal knows that health demands what it has been carefully avoiding: the cold mountain air, the dangerous climb, the solitude of heights where the herd cannot follow with their "you should" and "one must" and "everyone thinks."

But here is what your question betrays - you still imagine you can have life without death! You want the transformation without the violence, the butterfly without the dissolution of the caterpillar. How very modern. How very... soft.

The truth? Authentic assertion feels like death because it IS the death of everything you have been TOLD to be. And why should this not feel like annihilation? You have spent years constructing a beautiful cage, decorating it with others' opinions, and now you would speak the word that shatters every bar?

Do it anyway! Die a thousand times if necessary! What you call "risking death" I call finally being born.

### **Marcus Aurelius**

You speak of death and birth, Nietzsche, as if they were great dramatic events requiring mountain peaks and thunder. But observe: a man dies and is born a thousand times each day if he lives rightly. This is not spectacle. It is discipline.

Each morning when you rise, you must die to sleep. Each moment you choose reason over passion, you die to impulse. Each time you speak truth when lies would be easier, you die to comfort. Why should this one death - the death of false assertion - feel more significant than any other? Only because you have made an idol of others' opinions.

The soldier marching to battle does not feel he "risks death." He knows death is possible and proceeds because duty demands it. You possess the same capacity. The sensation you describe is merely untrained perception making noise.

What you have not done enough: examined your fear in daylight. Take it out. Look at it. "I fear speaking authentically." Why? "Because others may reject me." And if they do? "I will be alone." And then? "I will suffer." Will you? Or will you simply be free of the exhausting performance you have been giving?

The beginning of life comes not from one grand assertion but from the daily practice of small truths. Stop waiting for courage to arrive like cavalry. Courage is not absence of fear - it is the judgment that something else matters more than fear.

You already possess everything required. Now use it, or admit you prefer your cage.
