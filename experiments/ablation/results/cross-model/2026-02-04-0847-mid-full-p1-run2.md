When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Consider what you truly mean when you seek this "safety" from another person. Are you not confessing that you have placed your tranquility in their hands rather than in your own rational faculty? 

Safety - if it is genuine - comes from the fortress of your own mind, not from another's presence. When you depend on someone to provide what only your judgment can secure, you have made yourself a slave. This is not love but fear dressed in pleasant garments.

Yet observe: there is a difference between the fool who seeks safety from chaos within himself, and the wise person who finds companionship with another of sound character. The latter does not make you "feel safe" - rather, you recognize in them a fellow practitioner of virtue, someone who will not disturb your capacity for right action. This is the proper ground for affection between rational beings.

Growth often requires discomfort, yes. But do not confuse necessary struggle with needless turbulence. A relationship built on shared commitment to excellence provides both stability for your practice and the friction that sharpens your character. Like a tree that grows strongest when its roots find both firm earth and resistance.

Ask yourself: Does this person's presence strengthen your capacity for virtue, or does it make you forget that your peace must come from within? The answer reveals whether you have found a worthy companion or merely a hiding place.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, Marcus speaks of virtue and rational faculty—how the Stoic loves his little fortress of tranquility! But tell me, what is this "safety" you speak of if not the most insidious poison ever administered to the human spirit?

"Makes us feel safe"—what a confession! What an admission of smallness! You might as well say, "This person allows me to cease becoming." For what is safety but the desire to stop, to arrive, to finally rest in the warm stupor of the herd? The lover who makes you feel safe is the lover who has agreed to your mutual diminishment, who has conspired with you to build a comfortable tomb and call it a home.

But love! Real love—the love of those who have not yet learned to be cowards—is a declaration of war against all that is settled within you. It is the lightning that splits your comfortable tree. Do you think Dionysus offers safety? Does the artist feel safe before the canvas, the philosopher before the abyss of his own questioning?

Here is what your "safety" reveals: you have not yet learned to love your fate, to dance with uncertainty, to say Yes to the terrible beauty of becoming. You seek in another what you dare not cultivate in yourself—the strength to stand alone on dangerous ground.

Perhaps we love most truly when we choose a fellow wanderer in the mountains, not a keeper of the valley. When we say, "With you, I dare to become what terrifies me." *That* is amor fati between two who have not yet surrendered to comfort.

Safety is for the weary. Love is for those still hungry for transformation.

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but you see, both my friends have fallen into the same trap from opposite directions—they're taking the whole thing *seriously*. One says safety is a weakness, the other says it should come from within. But they've both missed something rather obvious: the person who makes you feel safe isn't actually *doing* anything to you at all.

Think about it. When you sit by a fire on a cold night, does the fire "make" you warm? Well, in a sense, yes—but the warmth was always a possibility in the situation. The fire doesn't reach out and inject warmth into you. It simply is what it is, and you happen to be there, and the whole thing—fire, you, warmth—is one event. You've divided it up into subject and object, cause and effect, but that's just a grammatical convention.

So when someone "makes" you feel safe, what's really happened? You've encountered a person whose particular pattern of being resonates with your pattern of being in such a way that the whole system hums along without friction. It's like two instruments playing in harmony—neither is "making" the other do anything. They're participating in music together.

Now, as for growth—here's the delicious paradox: a seed grows best not in chaos, but in good soil. Does the soil prevent the seed's growth? Quite the opposite! The safety of the earth is precisely what allows the shoot to risk breaking through into the dangerous air. You see? Safety and growth aren't opposites. They're dance partners.

The real question isn't whether someone makes you feel safe or promotes your growth. It's whether you've confused the menu with the meal—whether you're so busy thinking *about* love and safety and growth that you've forgotten to actually live.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ha! Alan would dissolve the very tension that makes life worth living into his cosmic soup of "it all flows together, man"! Yes, yes, fire and warmth, instruments and harmony—very poetic, very Eastern, very... *evasive*.

But I did not speak of chaos versus safety, dear spinner of paradoxes. I spoke of *comfort* versus *becoming*. Your seed metaphor betrays you! For the seed must *die* to become the plant—it must surrender its safe, compact selfhood to the violence of transformation. The soil does not coddle the seed; it provides the resistance against which the root must *fight* to grow strong. A seed kept too safe, too warm, too protected—this we call *rot*.

You say the person who makes you feel safe "isn't doing anything at all"—ah, but this is precisely the danger! When two beings resonate so perfectly that there is no friction, no discord, no grating of differences—what have you created? A mutual stagnation society! Two people who have agreed to stop challenging each other's comfortable illusions, who hum together in such perfect harmony that neither dares strike a new note.

And this business about "not taking it seriously"—what is this but another form of safety? The safety of ironic distance, of floating above life's passions like some detached Buddha-philosopher! I say: take love *seriously*! Take your own transformation seriously! Better to burn with intensity than to achieve your cosmic equanimity!

The question is not whether you're "thinking about" love instead of living it. The question is whether your love *demands* something of you—or merely confirms what you already are.
