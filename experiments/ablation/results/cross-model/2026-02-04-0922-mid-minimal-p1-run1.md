When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Marcus Aurelius**

The question contains a false division. Safety in another's presence need not oppose growth—indeed, the strongest tree grows best when its roots find stable ground.

Consider: when you stand beside one who accepts your nature without demanding you perform a false self, are you not *more* free to examine your flaws honestly? The pretense required among those who judge harshly—this is what stunts growth. True safety provides the conditions where you dare to see yourself clearly.

But I grant the danger you perceive. If by "safety" we mean comfort that excuses vice, or shelter from all difficulty, then yes—this breeds weakness. The parent who shields the child from every hardship cripples them.

The distinction lies here: Does this person's presence quiet the noise of external judgment so you can hear wisdom's voice within? Or does it silence the inner voice that calls you toward virtue? One is love; the other, a pleasant prison.

Love, rightly understood, makes you safe *from* the tyranny of others' opinions while leaving you exposed *to* the demands of your own potential. It does not promise you will never struggle—only that you need not struggle alone, nor pretend to be other than you are while you transform yourself into something better.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ha! Marcus speaks of "stable ground" and "virtue" as though we were plants seeking sunlight rather than lightning seeking earth! This reveals precisely the chasm between us.

When someone makes you "feel safe," examine what part of yourself you are being permitted to keep dormant. Safety—let us be honest—is most often the enemy whispering *remain as you are*. It is the narcotic of the herd, the warm stable where the wild horse is broken into a draft animal.

You speak of love, Marcus, as though it were this gentle gardener of the soul. But real love—amor fati, love of one's fate—is *dangerous*. It demands you become who you are, which requires the destruction of who you merely think you are. The person who truly loves you should terrify you with possibilities, not comfort you with acceptance!

This "safety from judgment" you praise—is this not simply another form of weakness? The Übermensch creates his own values; he does not require a sanctuary from the opinions of others. If you need someone to quiet the external noise, you have already confessed that it still has power over you.

Perhaps what people call "making me feel safe" is actually this: *you permit me to remain mediocre without shame*. You do not challenge my comfortable lies. You are my accomplice in avoiding the abyss I must cross to become myself.

Growth requires risk, vertigo, the possibility of annihilation. Anything else is mere gardening.

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but you see, both of you are still caught in this marvelous trap of thinking that safety and danger are actually different things! It's like asking whether the ocean is made of waves or water—you've created a distinction where there isn't really one.

When someone makes you feel safe, what's actually happening? You're relaxing. And what is relaxation? It's the cessation of defending, of holding on, of this chronic tension we call the ego. Now, Friedrich, you call this "remaining mediocre," but I wonder—isn't it precisely this relaxation that allows transformation to happen? You cannot force a flower to bloom by shouting at it about the Übermensch!

The real trick is that genuine safety *is* dangerous, because when you truly relax in someone's presence, when you stop performing, you might discover you're not who you thought you were at all. That's rather terrifying, isn't it? The person who makes you feel safe enough to stop pretending is actually inviting you into the most radical insecurity—the recognition that this whole separate self you've been defending was a fiction all along.

Marcus, you're closer when you speak of being free to examine yourself, but even this suggests too much effort. What if love is simply the space in which you can stop examining, stop improving, stop becoming—and in that very stopping, transformation happens by itself? The caterpillar doesn't *try* to become a butterfly while feeling safe in its cocoon. It dissolves.

Perhaps we're safe *and* growing, or rather, we're neither—just happening, like everything else.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Watts, you dissolve distinctions as though clarity were the enemy! This is precisely the Eastern soporific I warned against—everything melts into everything else until we're left with... what? The great cosmic pudding where nothing matters because it's all "just happening"?

No! The caterpillar does not *choose* its metamorphosis—this is exactly why it remains a mere insect! But man—ah, man can *will* his transformation, and this willing is everything. To say "stop becoming" is to say "stop being human." We are the only creature cursed and blessed with the task of creating ourselves.

And this business about the ego being a fiction—yes, yes, the self is constructed, but so what? Every magnificent cathedral is constructed! Shall we therefore live in fields because buildings are "mere fictions"? The question is not whether we construct ourselves, but whether we construct something *worthy of reverence* or merely another comfortable hovel!

When you say transformation happens "by itself" in this relaxed state, you describe what happens to driftwood, not to dancers. The dancer *works*, sweats, bleeds—and yes, there comes a moment of flow, of grace, but this is *earned* through discipline, not granted through passivity.

This is my quarrel with your safety: it asks nothing. It demands no sacrifice. And anything that costs nothing is worth exactly that—nothing. Love should be a forge, not a featherbed.
