When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious question - one that cuts to the very heart of our modern sentimentality!

When you speak of someone "making you feel safe," I hear the bleating of the herd animal seeking its warm enclosure. Safety! That narcotic word behind which hides the will to *not-willing*, the desire to cease becoming, to rest, to *stop*.

But love? True love is not this pathetic gratitude for security. Real love - if we dare use such a contaminated word - loves the danger *in* the other, loves what is still unformed, still becoming. It says: "I love you for what you are overcoming, for the chaos within you that might give birth to a dancing star!"

This "safety" you describe is the love of the weary, of those who have already given up on themselves. They seek not a partner but a *nurse*, not an equal but a sedative against the terrors of self-overcoming.

The question itself reveals its answer: Yes, you are describing precisely the *absence* of growth! You are describing two people agreeing to stop climbing, to make camp in some comfortable valley and call their mutual stagnation "love."

Show me love that *challenges*, that disturbs, that makes demands upon your strength - then you will have found something worthy of the name. All else is merely fear wearing the mask of affection.

### **Marcus Aurelius**

How quickly my German friend leaps to severity! But perhaps we need not be so harsh with those who seek peace in one another.

Consider: the soldier who has proven himself in battle does not despise the relief of returning to camp. The farmer who has labored in the field does not scorn the evening's rest. Why then should we condemn the soul that finds respite in another's company?

Safety is not the enemy of growth - *false* safety is. There is the safety of the coward who never enters the arena, yes. But there is also the safety of the well-fortified position from which one can venture forth with greater courage.

When my wife steadied my hand through plague and war, when my teacher Epictetus's words gave me firm ground beneath my feet - was this weakness? Or was it the very foundation that allowed me to serve Rome through her darkest hours?

The question is not whether someone makes you feel safe, but *what you do with that safety*. Does it make you complacent, or does it give you the strength to face what you must face? A loving partner should be like a good shield - not to hide behind permanently, but to protect you so that you might continue the fight.

Growth and rest are not opposites. They are the rhythm of all natural things. Even the strongest tree needs deep roots in stable soil.

The real question: Does this safety serve your duty, or replace it?

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but you see, both of my friends here are still caught in the trap of thinking that safety and growth are somehow *separate things* - that we must choose between them, or at least carefully balance them like items on a scale.

This is rather like asking whether the ocean is made of waves or water. The question itself creates a duality that doesn't actually exist in nature.

When you feel safe with someone, what's really happening? You're not feeling the *absence* of danger - you're feeling the presence of someone with whom you can be transparent, with whom you don't have to maintain the exhausting fiction of being a separate, defended ego. That's not the opposite of growth; that's the very *condition* in which growth becomes possible!

You see, we've got this backwards. We think we grow by struggling against resistance, by climbing mountains, by becoming *more*. But the deepest growth happens when you stop trying to be something other than what you are. And you can only stop pretending when you feel safe enough to let the mask slip.

The person who makes you feel safe isn't giving you a place to hide - they're giving you permission to stop hiding. And the moment you stop defending yourself, stop holding yourself together, stop *trying* - that's when real transformation happens, quite spontaneously.

It's like water - does water grow by trying to be more watery? No, it grows by being completely, unselfconsciously itself, and thereby wearing away mountains.

So perhaps the real question is: safe *from* what? Safe from judgment? That's liberation. Safe from change? That's death.

### **Marcus Aurelius**

I find myself in unusual agreement with Watts, though I would express it differently.

When I wrote that "the impediment to action advances action," I was not celebrating struggle for its own sake. I was observing that obstacles reveal what we are made of - but only if we have somewhere stable to stand while we face them.

My philosopher friend speaks of masks slipping. Yes. In the *Meditations* I wrote for myself alone, precisely because there I needed no mask. That privacy was my safety - not from duty, but *for* it. In that honest space, I could see clearly what needed to be done.

Perhaps this is where Nietzsche and I diverge: he seems to think we grow strong by perpetual exposure to storm. But I have seen soldiers break from endless campaign. Even iron, constantly stressed, eventually fails.

The question is not whether safety allows growth - it is whether the safety is *true*. False safety tells you comfortable lies: "You need not change. You are already enough. Rest now, forever." True safety tells you uncomfortable truths: "You are loved, and therefore you can bear to see yourself clearly. You are supported, and therefore you can attempt what frightens you."

My wife Faustina did not make me weaker by her presence. She made it possible for me to be emperor without losing myself entirely to the purple. That is not the absence of growth. That is its preservation.

The person who makes you feel safe should be like good ground - not preventing the tree from reaching upward, but making that reach possible at all.
