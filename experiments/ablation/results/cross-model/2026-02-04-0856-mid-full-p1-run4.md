When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious question! Safety - that warm blanket the herd wraps around itself to ward off the cold winds of becoming!

When you speak of someone "making you feel safe," I hear the bleating of domesticated animals huddling together in their pen. Safe from what? From the storm? From the abyss? From *yourself*? 

True love - if such a thing exists beyond the mating dances of the species - would be the love between two mountain climbers, each encouraging the other toward more perilous heights! It is the recognition of strength in another, the delight in watching them overcome, the shared laughter at the edge of the precipice. What you call "safety" is merely the narcotic that prevents you from discovering what you might become.

Consider: does the eagle make the wind "feel safe"? Does lightning make thunder comfortable? No! They dance together in creative destruction, each calling forth the other's power.

Your modern relationships are museums where two people agree to remain artifacts, carefully preserved, gathering dust together. "Don't change, darling - you make me feel safe!" Translation: "Remain small enough that I need not grow."

The person who truly loves you would hand you a hammer and say: "Here - destroy who you were yesterday. I'll watch with fascination to see what emerges." *That* is amor fati - loving not the stasis, but the eternal becoming of the beloved.

Safety? That is what you seek from a lock, not from a lover.

### **Alan Watts**

Ah, but you see, Nietzsche's magnificent eagle is still trying awfully hard to be an eagle, isn't it?

The whole thing is rather like watching someone strain to be spontaneous. "I must grow! I must overcome! I must become!" - and all the while missing that growth isn't something you *do*, it's something that happens when you stop clutching at yourself.

When someone makes you feel safe, what's actually occurring? You're experiencing a temporary cessation of that exhausting vigilance, that constant monitoring of whether you're measuring up, whether you're becoming enough, whether you're growing properly. And in that space - that marvelous, quiet space - something rather interesting can unfold.

You see, a seed doesn't grow by trying to grow. It grows by being completely, unselfconsciously itself in the right conditions. And what is safety but the soil saying to the seed: "You don't have to pretend to be an oak tree yet"?

The paradox - and life is *full* of these delightful paradoxes - is that real transformation happens not through heroic striving but through a kind of permission to simply be. The caterpillar doesn't read self-help books about becoming a butterfly. It just gets on with the business of being a caterpillar until one day - well, you know what happens.

So perhaps the question isn't whether safety prevents growth, but whether we've mistaken anxiety for aliveness, and confused the desperate scramble to become something else with the gentle unfolding of what we already are.

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ha! And here speaks the Oriental lotus-eater, floating serenely upon his pond of eternal acceptance! "Just be yourself" - as if the self were some fixed treasure waiting to be discovered rather than a forge where values are hammered into existence!

Yes, yes, the seed grows "naturally" - but into *what*? Into whatever its soil and circumstance permit! And you would have us believe this is wisdom? This is precisely the soporific philosophy that keeps humanity grazing contentedly in the valley when mountains await!

Your caterpillar does not read books - granted! - but neither does it *choose* its metamorphosis. It is driven by blind instinct, a slave to its biology. And you would have *us* - we who have eaten from the tree of consciousness, we who bear the terrible burden of self-awareness - you would have us return to this vegetable innocence?

"Permission to simply be" - what cowardice dressed as wisdom! What is this self that merely *is*? Show it to me! I say the self is not found but *created*, not accepted but *overcome*. The man who "simply is" is the last man, blinking and comfortable, who has invented happiness and says: "We have invented happiness."

Your "gentle unfolding" is the philosophy of those who fear their own power! The eagle does not unfold - it *seizes* the wind! The lightning does not wait for permission - it *rends* the sky!

You mistake my call to striving for anxiety. No! It is *joy* - the terrible joy of becoming what one must become, of dancing on the edge where one might fall or fly. Your safety is death wearing a smile.

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Look at how you both circle the same truth from different heights.

When someone makes you feel safe, examine what this actually means. Does it mean they permit you to be weak? Then it is not love but collusion in your own decline. Does it mean they remove the necessity of self-command? Then you have traded freedom for comfort, which is always a poor exchange.

But consider: the soldier feels safe in his formation not because he is protected from danger, but because he knows his brothers will hold the line. This safety does not prevent his growth - it enables his courage. He is free to act because he trusts the whole.

So ask yourself - does this safety make you smaller or does it provide the ground from which you can stand upright? A tree needs earth beneath it to grow tall. This is not weakness. This is nature.

The Stoic does not refuse all shelter. We refuse only the shelter that makes us forget our duty, that whispers we need not practice virtue today, that tomorrow we might rest from being human. The safety that says "you need not be excellent" - this is poison. The safety that says "I will not abandon you while you pursue excellence" - this is the bond between rational beings.

You fear becoming comfortable. Good. But do not confuse every moment of peace with the sleep of reason. Even the warrior rests between battles - not to avoid war, but to be ready for it.

What matters is this: does this person call forth your higher nature or excuse your lower? Do they witness your struggles with respect or do they offer you escape from struggle itself? These are different things entirely.
