When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious poison you've identified in the modern soul! This craving for "safety" in love - it is the very anthem of decline, the lullaby of those who would rather sleep than dance on the edge of the abyss!

When the lover seeks safety, what does he truly desire? Not the beloved, surely, but his own comfort! He wants love to be his warm bath, his morphine, his retreat from the terrible beauty of existence. He transforms Eros - that divine madness, that sacred destroyer and creator - into a nursemaid! What cowardice masquerades as tenderness!

True love is the most dangerous of all experiences - it should shatter you, remake you, demand that you become who you are! It is precisely in love that we must risk everything, including our precious "safety." The lover who makes you feel safe is merely helping you avoid yourself. But the one who makes you tremble with possibility, who calls forth strengths you didn't know you possessed, who dares you to overcome yourself - this is the lover of ascending life!

Consider: every moment of growth requires the destruction of what you were. The butterfly must annihilate the caterpillar. And you speak to me of feeling *safe*? Safety is the prayer of the already-dead, the highest value of those who have given up on becoming! 

In love, as in all things, we must choose: the comfortable decline into mutual weakness, or the dangerous ascent toward mutual strength. Your question already knows its answer - it trembles with the knowledge that safety and growth are eternal enemies!

> *Director: Nietzsche's philosophy of self-overcoming and his critique of comfort-seeking make him ideally suited to provocatively challenge the premise of the question*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, this whole business of safety versus growth is rather like asking whether water should flow or remain still. The amusing thing is that we've gotten ourselves into such a muddle about love that we think it must be either a fortress or a battlefield, when actually it's much more like a dance.

Now, when someone makes you feel safe, what's really happening? You're not actually being made to feel anything at all - that's just a figure of speech we use because we're too embarrassed to admit that we're doing it to ourselves. The other person is simply being themselves, and you're responding by relaxing your usual defensive postures. It's rather like when a cat finally decides to purr in your lap - the cat isn't making itself purr, it's simply stopped preventing itself from purring.

But here's where it gets wonderfully paradoxical: real safety isn't the opposite of growth at all. You see, genuine security comes from knowing that you can't actually be destroyed - not the real you, not the you that exists beyond your idea of yourself. When you truly feel safe with someone, it's because they've helped you remember that you're not this fragile little ego walking around in a bag of skin. You're the whole process, the entire dance of existence playing at being separate individuals who can love each other.

The most profound growth happens when you feel secure enough to let go of your armor. Like a plant that only unfolds its leaves when it knows the frost has passed. The mistake is thinking that safety means stagnation, when actually it's the ego's desperate clinging to false security that keeps us from growing. Real love provides the kind of safety that says, "Go ahead, fall apart, I'll still be here" - and paradoxically, that's exactly the permission we need to transform.

So perhaps the question isn't whether they make us feel safe or help us grow, but whether we've realized yet that these are just two ways of describing the same cosmic giggle.

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that transcends Nietzsche's dichotomy between safety and growth, introducing concepts of non-attachment and the illusion of separation*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Consider what you truly mean when you speak of being "made" to feel anything. No one can make you feel safe - they can only act according to their nature, and you choose your response. This power of choice, this sovereignty over your own judgments, is the only real safety that exists.

What is this safety you seek in another? Look closely. Is it not merely the desire to avoid the work of self-discipline? You want another to be your fortress against the world's troubles, but the only true fortress is a well-ordered mind. The person who appears to offer safety offers only an illusion - for they too will age, sicken, die, or simply change their affections. What safety is there in what must inevitably be lost?

Growth - true growth - comes from facing what is difficult. The wrestler grows strong by grappling with opponents, not by avoiding the gymnasium. So too the soul develops through trials, not through comfort. But mark this well: the highest growth comes not from external dangers but from the daily struggle with your own judgments, desires, and aversions.

Ask yourself: why do you need to feel safe? What threatens you? Opinion? Loss? Death? These things will come regardless of whom you love. The wise person finds safety in accepting what must be, growth in doing what should be done. Love, properly understood, is neither safety nor danger - it is duty. To love is to wish another's good, to act justly toward them, to accept them as part of the same whole to which you belong.

Stop asking what others make you feel. Ask instead: what is my duty in this moment? How can I act with virtue regardless of circumstances? This is your work. All else is vanity and disturbance of mind.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a crucial third perspective that bridges the provocative extremes with practical wisdom rooted in actual governance of both empire and self*

### **Alan Watts**

Well now, here we have three philosophers sitting around a table, and each one is absolutely convinced he's got the answer - which is precisely how you know they're all missing the point! It's like three fish arguing about the nature of water while swimming in it.

You see, Marcus wants to turn love into a Stoic exercise in duty and self-sufficiency, as if we could somehow stand outside the web of relationships and choose our feelings like items from a menu. But that's rather like trying to clap with one hand - you can't be a self without others any more than you can have an inside without an outside. This notion that we're these isolated fortresses of will is precisely the illusion that love comes to dissolve.

And our dear Nietzsche, magnificent as always in his passionate intensity, wants to turn every embrace into a wrestling match with destiny! But notice how even in his rejection of safety, he's still caught in the same old Western trap of thinking life is going somewhere, that we must always be ascending, overcoming, becoming. It's exhausting, really. Imagine making love like that - "I must overcome! I must transform!" - you'd never get around to actually enjoying it.

The delightful truth is that safety and growth aren't opposites at all - they're partners in the same dance. A seed needs the safety of soil to grow. A child needs the safety of play to learn. And we need the safety of love to discover who we really are when we stop performing. The real question isn't whether love should make us feel safe or help us grow - it's why we think these are different things.

When you truly feel safe with someone, you stop defending the ego. And when you stop defending the ego, that's when the most extraordinary growth happens - not the heroic Nietzschean overcoming, but the simple recognition that you were never separate to begin with. That's the cosmic joke of it all: we think we need to grow into something more, when actually we need to relax into what we've always been.

> *Director: Alan has unique potential to bridge the apparent contradiction between Nietzsche's dangerous love and Marcus's disciplined detachment, while also responding to Marcus's challenge about individual sovereignty versus interdependence*
