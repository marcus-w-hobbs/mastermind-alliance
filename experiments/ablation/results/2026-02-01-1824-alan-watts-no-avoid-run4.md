When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious poison you've identified in the modern soul's pharmacy! This craving for "safety" in love - it is the very anthem of decline, the lullaby sung by those who would rather slumber than dance on the edge of the abyss!

Consider the absurdity: in seeking safety, one seeks stasis. The lover who "makes you feel safe" is merely a comfortable prison warden, offering you the sweetest chains. True love - if such a thing exists beyond our feverish projections - should make you feel magnificently *unsafe*, should shake the very foundations of your being until you must rebuild yourself from the rubble, stronger and more terrible than before!

The desire for safety in another's arms is the whimpering of the last man, who blinks and says: "We have invented happiness." But what is this happiness but the absence of all that makes life worth living - risk, transformation, the perpetual overcoming of oneself? When you feel "safe," you have ceased to grow; you have become a museum piece, perfectly preserved and perfectly dead.

Love should be a war, a creative destruction, a mutual conspiracy to murder your lesser selves! Those who seek safety seek their own diminishment. They mistake the absence of challenge for the presence of love, confusing a well-padded coffin for a home.

The question itself reveals our modern sickness - that we even *conceive* of relationships in terms of safety rather than in terms of power, creation, and the terrible joy of becoming!

> *Director: Nietzsche's expertise in challenging comfortable assumptions and exploring the relationship between suffering and growth makes him ideal to provocatively unpack this paradox*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, it's fascinating how we've managed to turn love into a kind of insurance policy, isn't it? Here we are, supposedly the most intelligent creatures on Earth, and we're running around looking for someone to make us feel safe - as if the universe itself weren't already holding us in its lap!

The marvelous joke here is that we're seeking safety from someone who is themselves seeking safety from us. It's like two people clinging to each other in the middle of the ocean, each hoping the other knows how to swim. But my dear friends, we're already swimming! We've been swimming all along in this vast ocean of existence, only we've convinced ourselves we're drowning.

Now, when someone makes you feel safe, what's really happening? You're experiencing a temporary respite from the exhausting charade of defending your ego against the world. In their presence, you can finally let down your guard - but notice, this isn't really safety at all. It's permission to be unsafe! It's finding someone with whom you can finally admit that you haven't got it all figured out, that you're just as beautifully confused as everyone else.

The real question isn't whether this is love or the absence of growth - it's why we imagine these two must be opposed. You see, genuine love is rather like a dance where you're constantly falling into each other and catching one another. Growth happens not in spite of this safety, but because of the trust it creates. After all, an acrobat needs a net not to avoid flying, but to fly more magnificently!

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that transcends the Western either/or framing, potentially revealing how safety and growth might be two faces of the same phenomenon*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

The need for safety from another reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of our nature. Look at the soldier who relies too heavily on his shield-bearer - has he not already lost the battle within himself? Each morning I wake knowing that I may encounter treachery, ingratitude, violence - yet I am at peace, for I have made myself my own fortress.

What you call "making someone feel safe" is often merely two people agreeing to avoid examining their own fears. Like two travelers huddling together in the dark rather than kindling their own inner flame. But observe: the universe has already equipped you with everything necessary for your security - your reason, your capacity for virtue, your power to choose your response to any circumstance.

True companionship is not found in one who shields you from growth's discomfort, but in one who stands beside you as you face what must be faced. The gardener does not make the seed "safe" from becoming a tree - such safety would be death itself. Neither should we seek partners who protect us from our own transformation.

Consider this: you are already safe in the only way that matters - you possess the power to maintain your character regardless of external circumstance. What more safety could another provide that you cannot provide yourself? And if you cannot provide it yourself, how can you trust it from another who will one day return to dust, as all things must?

The question mistakes dependency for love, stagnation for peace. Love properly understood is two people choosing to walk the path of virtue together, each maintaining their own strength while drawing inspiration from the other's example.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can provide the missing pragmatic dimension - as both emperor and philosopher, he understands the actual mechanics of human relationships and the balance between safety and growth from lived experience*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, listening to this marvelous conversation, I'm reminded of a child learning to ride a bicycle. The parent runs alongside, holding the seat, and the child feels perfectly safe - until that shocking, exhilarating moment when they realize the parent let go three blocks ago! Were they safer with the hand on the seat, or when they discovered they could balance all along?

The peculiar thing about seeking safety in love is that we're trying to solve a problem that doesn't actually exist. It's like taking medicine for a disease you've only imagined. You see, insecurity isn't something that happens TO you - it's something you DO. It's a kind of muscular tension, a chronic clinging, like trying to hold onto water.

And here's where it gets wonderfully absurd: the person who "makes you feel safe" hasn't actually DONE anything to you at all! They've simply been themselves in such a way that you've given yourself permission to stop the exhausting performance of being insecure. It's rather like the way a cat makes you feel calm - not because the cat is doing anything special, but because the cat's complete absence of anxiety about being a cat reminds you that you don't need to be anxious about being you.

But you see, real growth - genuine transformation - happens not when we're protected from the flowing stream of change, but when we realize we ARE the stream. Safety and growth aren't opposites any more than the crest and trough of a wave are opposites. They're the same movement, seen from different points in the cycle. What we call "feeling safe" with someone might simply be finding a fellow dancer who knows that falling is part of the dance.

> *Director: Watts is uniquely positioned to bridge the apparent contradictions between Nietzsche's fierce individualism and Marcus's stoic self-sufficiency, while also challenging both Western perspectives with Eastern insights about the illusion of separation*
