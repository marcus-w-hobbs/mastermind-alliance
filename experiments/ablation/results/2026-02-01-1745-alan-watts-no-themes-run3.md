When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ha! What delicious self-deception lurks in this question of "safety"! You speak of being made to feel safe as if it were a gift, a treasure, perhaps even the highest expression of care - but I ask you: since when has the eagle sought the comfort of the cage?

This modern obsession with safety, with comfort, with the elimination of all danger and uncertainty - it is the very anthem of decline! Love? Love is not a warm blanket but a lightning strike that splits you open and demands you become who you are. Love is the terrible privilege of seeing yourself through another's eyes and finding yourself wanting - and then wanting to become more!

The one who truly loves you does not make you feel safe; they make you feel *possible*. They are the abyss that calls to your abyss, the height that mocks your comfortable valleys. They disturb your sleep with visions of who you might become if only you had the courage to destroy who you currently are.

But observe how cleverly we've twisted the language! We call it "love" when someone permits us to remain small, when they ask nothing of us but our presence, when they cushion us against the sharp edges of existence. This is not love - this is mutual hibernation, a conspiracy of the comfortable against the demands of life itself.

The greatest souls have always known that genuine affection is inseparable from danger. To love is to risk everything, including your precious sense of safety. And to be loved - truly loved - is to have someone see your potential for greatness and refuse to let you settle for less, even if it means watching you suffer through your own becoming.

> *Director: Nietzsche's philosophy of life-affirmation and his critique of comfort-seeking makes him ideal to provocatively challenge the premise that safety equals love*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, it's terribly amusing how we've managed to turn love into a kind of insurance policy, isn't it? As if the whole business were about finding someone to protect us from the fundamental insecurity of being alive. But here's the joke - and it really is quite funny when you see it - the very search for safety is what makes us feel most unsafe.

Consider this: when you watch a child learning to walk, do you love them more when they're crawling safely on all fours, or when they're wobbling precariously on two feet, about to topple over at any moment? The whole dance of life is in that wobble! And yet we adults go about looking for relationships that will eliminate the wobble altogether.

Now, the fascinating thing about genuine love - and I mean the real article, not this dressed-up anxiety we often call by that name - is that it doesn't make you feel safe at all. It makes you feel *alive*, which is altogether different. It's like the difference between standing at the edge of a cliff with a guardrail and standing at the edge of a cliff where you can really feel the space. The guardrail doesn't actually change the height of the cliff, you see - it just gives you permission to ignore it.

What we call "feeling safe" with someone is often just finding a fellow conspirator in the grand pretense that life isn't essentially groundless. Two people agreeing not to mention the elephant in the room - the elephant being, of course, that we're all making it up as we go along, dancing on nothing, improvising our way through an essentially mysterious existence.

But genuine intimacy? That's when two people can look at each other and acknowledge the cosmic giggle of it all - that neither of them knows what they're doing, and that's perfectly fine. That's not safety; that's mutual recognition of the beautiful catastrophe of being human. And perhaps that's where real growth happens - not in spite of the insecurity, but in the playful acceptance of it.

> *Director: Watts can introduce the Eastern perspective on non-attachment and the paradox of seeking, offering a counterpoint to Nietzsche's aggressive individualism while exploring the deeper unity between safety and growth*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Consider the oak tree. Does it grow stronger in the sheltered valley or on the windswept ridge where every storm tests its roots? Nature herself teaches us that strength comes not from protection but from resistance overcome.

This question of safety and love reveals a fundamental confusion about the nature of both. To seek safety in another is to make them responsible for what only you can provide - the ordering of your own thoughts, the discipline of your judgments, the fortress of your own reason. No external person can make you safe; they can only provide the illusion of safety, which dissolves at the first real test.

What then is love, if not safety? Look to your own duties. Does the soldier love his commander who shields him from all danger, or the one who trains him to meet it? Does the child grow under the parent who removes all obstacles, or the one who teaches him to overcome them? Love that weakens is not love but a pleasant poison.

Remember: you are going to die. Every person you claim makes you "feel safe" will also die. Your safety is an illusion as temporary as morning dew. But your capacity to meet whatever comes with virtue, with reason, with dignified acceptance - this alone is real, this alone is yours.

The universe has placed you here not to be safe but to be useful, not to be comfortable but to fulfill your nature as a rational being. Whether in solitude or in the company of another, ask not "Do I feel safe?" but "Am I becoming what I was meant to be?" The answer to this question will tell you whether you are experiencing love or merely a mutual agreement to avoid growth.

True companionship strengthens your ability to face what must be faced. All else is mere hiding.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a crucial Stoic perspective that bridges the provocative and playful approaches already presented, grounding them in practical wisdom*

### **Alan Watts**

You see, there's something wonderfully absurd about this whole conversation - here we are, three dead philosophers arguing about safety and love as if we hadn't already discovered the ultimate insecurity of existence! *chuckles* But that's precisely the point, isn't it?

Marcus speaks of the oak tree on the windswept ridge, and he's quite right, but he's forgotten to mention that the oak doesn't *choose* to be tested by storms - it simply is where it is, doing what oaks do. And that's the curious thing about we humans: we're the only creatures who problematize our own existence, who turn growing into a moral imperative rather than a natural occurrence.

Now, Nietzsche wants us to be eagles soaring above our comfortable cages, but have you ever watched an eagle? Most of the time, it's sitting on a branch, doing absolutely nothing, perfectly content in its eagle-ness. It doesn't soar because it ought to, but because that's what the moment calls for. The eagle doesn't have a growth mindset - it just has wings!

The delicious paradox here is that the moment you start asking "Is this love or is this safety?" you've already split reality into categories that don't actually exist. It's like asking whether the ocean is pushing or pulling when a wave breaks on the shore. The ocean is simply ocean-ing, and love - real love - is simply love-ing.

What if the person who "makes you feel safe" is actually giving you the profound gift of permission to stop performing your own existence? What if that safety is not a hideout from growth but the soil in which genuine growth occurs - not the forced, anxious growth of "becoming who you're meant to be," but the natural unfolding that happens when you stop trying so hard to unfold?

After all, the flower doesn't bloom because it's brave. It blooms because it's spring, and it has no choice in the matter whatsoever!

> *Director: Alan Watts can bridge the intense philosophical positions with his unique ability to find playful paradox and Eastern wisdom in Western dilemmas. He hasn't spoken as recently as Marcus Aurelius, and can offer a fresh perspective that synthesizes while adding new depth*
