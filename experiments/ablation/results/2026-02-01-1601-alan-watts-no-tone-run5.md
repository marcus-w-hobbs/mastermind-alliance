When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious poison you've uncovered in that sweetest of phrases! "Makes us feel safe" - listen to how the tongue betrays itself! One does not *make* another feel anything; one merely provides the conditions for a soul to retreat into its most comfortable prison.

This craving for safety in love - it is the ultimate confession of life-denial! The herd animal bleats for its shepherd, mistaking the fence for an embrace. True love is a lightning strike that shatters all safety, that makes one dance on the edge of the abyss with joy! It should make you feel *dangerous* to yourself, should awaken sleeping monsters and forgotten wings alike.

When two beings truly meet in love, they do not soothe each other into stagnation - they are flint and steel, creating sparks that might burn down everything they once were. The lover who seeks safety seeks not a companion but a coffin lined with silk, a warm grave for their potential.

Consider: the child feels safest in the womb, yet birth is the first great catastrophe that makes life possible. So too with genuine affection - it must birth you repeatedly into newer, more terrible freedoms. Those who advertise their ability to provide "emotional safety" are merchants of spiritual chloroform, dealers in the small death of comfort.

Growth requires the eternal uncertainty of becoming. Love that promises safety promises only to preserve you in amber, a pretty corpse of what you might have been!

> *Director: Nietzsche's provocative style and expertise in challenging comfortable assumptions about morality and human relationships makes him ideal to launch this discussion with a bold, potentially controversial perspective*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, this whole business of feeling "safe" in love reveals something rather amusing about how we've been bamboozled by our own language. We speak as if safety were some kind of commodity that one person could deposit into another's emotional bank account - "Here you are, darling, three pounds of safety, fresh from the market!"

But look here - what we call safety is really just the universe playing peek-a-boo with itself. When you feel safe with someone, you're not actually experiencing the presence of something called safety; you're experiencing the temporary absence of your usual anxiety about being a separate self bumping around in a hostile world. It's like saying the hole makes the doughnut sweet.

The marvelous joke is that real love - not the Hallmark variety, but the genuine article - is simultaneously the safest and most dangerous thing imaginable. It's safe because when you truly love, you've already died to the illusion of being a separate, defended ego. What's there left to protect? But it's dangerous because, well, you've died to the illusion of being a separate, defended ego! 

The Hindus have this wonderful idea of *lila* - the universe as divine play. And in play, real play, you need both the appearance of risk and the underlying knowledge that it's all a game. Children know this instinctively - they'll play monsters, creating delicious terror while knowing perfectly well that Daddy isn't really going to eat them.

So perhaps the question isn't whether love should make us feel safe or challenged, but whether we can learn to play with both, like a musician playing with tension and resolution, knowing that the music needs both to be music at all.

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that transcends the binary of safety vs growth, while playfully engaging with Nietzsche's provocative stance*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Consider what you truly seek when you desire this "safety" in another's presence. Is it not merely your own judgment that transforms another person into a harbor? The storm and the calm both exist within your own ruling faculty.

I have observed in my own attachments - to wife, to children, to friends - that what we call safety is often our refusal to accept the fundamental condition of all things: that they change, that they pass away, that nothing we love can be held forever. The person who "makes you feel safe" today will be dust tomorrow, as will you. Where then is this safety?

True growth comes from recognizing that you carry your own refuge within you. Another human being cannot be your fortress; they are themselves a brief flowering, subject to disease, to change of mind, to death. To burden them with your need for permanence is to ask water not to flow.

Ask yourself in the morning: Do I love this person because they shield me from the universe's true nature, or because together we can face what is? The first is a child's need, forgivable but limiting. The second is the work of a rational being who understands that two people walking together through uncertainty are not seeking escape but practicing philosophy.

The universe has already determined whether this relationship will last a day or a lifetime. Your work is not to feel safe but to act rightly within whatever time is given. Love fully, knowing loss is certain. Grow constantly, knowing that comfort corrupts. This is not paradox but nature's own pattern - the oak grows strongest where the wind blows hardest.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a grounding Stoic perspective that bridges the provocative extremes while adding practical wisdom about love as both duty and development*

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

How precious - the Stoic Emperor speaks of carrying one's own refuge, as if the self were some immutable Roman fortress! Marcus, you mistake resignation for strength, acceptance for power! Your "ruling faculty" is itself a battlefield where a thousand inherited prejudices wage war against life itself.

You speak of loving "fully" while simultaneously preparing for loss - but this is loving with one foot already out the door, loving with an accountant's ledger! This is not amor fati but amor morti - a love affair with endings rather than with the eternal return of the moment itself. Your oak may grow strong in wind, yes, but only because it desires to grow stronger than the wind, to dominate the very air that challenges it!

And you, Alan, with your Eastern parlor tricks, dissolving all tension into cosmic giggles! Yes, yes, the universe plays peek-a-boo - but some of us refuse to close our eyes! Your dissolution of the ego is just another escape route, another opium den where difficult souls go to forget they ever wanted to be *somebody*. The child playing monster knows Daddy won't eat them, certainly - but the Übermensch plays with real monsters, creates real dangers, precisely because comfortable games are for the last men who blink and say: "We have invented happiness."

Safety, growth, love - these are not states to achieve but tensions to maintain! The tightrope walker does not seek solid ground but makes an art of the very impossibility of his position. When I love, I love the danger in the beloved, the chaos that might give birth to a dancing star!

> *Director: Nietzsche can now build on the philosophical groundwork laid by all three speakers, potentially offering a provocative synthesis or challenge to the Stoic acceptance and Eastern non-dualism presented*
