When we say someone 'makes us feel safe,' are we describing love or the absence of growth?

---

### **Friedrich Nietzsche**

Ah, what a delicious poison you've identified in the modern soul's vocabulary! "Safety" - that warm blanket thrown over the shoulders of the declining, that lullaby sung to spirits too weary for the storm!

When the lover seeks safety, they seek not love but a coffin lined with silk. Love? Love is lightning that splits the tree! Love is the abyss that opens beneath your feet and whispers: "Jump, and perhaps you shall grow wings on the way down!" The one who makes you feel safe is your undertaker, preparing you for a comfortable burial in the cemetery of mediocrity.

Consider the plant that grows toward the sun - does it seek safety in the darkness of the soil? No! It risks everything, breaks through the earth, exposes itself to wind and storm and the burning light. This is growth, this is love - the dangerous dance at the edge of destruction!

The modern soul has confused love with insurance policies, passion with predictability. You want someone to "make you feel safe"? Then you want a guardian for your weakness, not a companion for your strength! True love should make you feel magnificently unsafe - it should challenge every comfortable lie you've told yourself, should demand that you become who you are not yet brave enough to be.

Safety is the prayer of the prey animal. But we who would create ourselves anew, we who would dance on the tightrope stretched over the abyss - we know that love is the wind that threatens to knock us into the depths, and thereby teaches us to dance!

> *Director: Nietzsche's provocative style and expertise in psychological insight, combined with his philosophy of life-affirmation through struggle, makes him ideal to challenge the comfortable assumption that safety equals love. He can immediately establish a dialectical tension that the others can build upon.*

### **Alan Watts**

You know, it's absolutely fascinating how we've managed to turn love into a sort of psychological insurance policy, isn't it? We go about looking for someone to make us feel safe, as if life itself weren't essentially a free fall through the cosmos - and here we are, trying to find someone to hold our hand while pretending we're not falling at all!

But look here - the whole notion that another person "makes" you feel anything is already missing the point entirely. It's like saying the mirror makes you beautiful or ugly. The mirror simply reflects what's there, and similarly, another person merely reveals the love or fear that's already dancing around in your own consciousness.

The delicious paradox is that real security comes precisely from recognizing there isn't any. It's like learning to swim - you can't really do it while you're still trying to keep one foot on the bottom. The moment you trust the water to hold you up is the moment you discover you knew how to float all along. And isn't that what we call love? That complete letting go into the experience of another person, which is really just another way of experiencing yourself?

Now, growth - growth is what happens when you stop trying to grow, just as you fall asleep by not trying to fall asleep. The flower doesn't strain to bloom; it simply unfolds when the conditions are right. And perhaps what we're really asking when we seek "safety" in love is for someone with whom we can stop holding our breath, stop sucking in our stomachs, stop performing the exhausting charade of being someone we're not. In that sense, the safety IS the growth - the permission to finally be what you've always been anyway.

> *Director: Watts can offer a paradoxical Eastern perspective that transcends Nietzsche's binary of safety versus growth, potentially revealing how both arise from the same source*

### **Marcus Aurelius**

Consider the oak that stands firm in the storm - is it safe, or merely prepared? The wise emperor does not seek safety from battle but discipline within it. So too with what men call love.

This morning I observed a soldier training with his shield. He does not carry it because he fears the sword, but because he accepts the reality of swords. The shield does not make him safe - it makes him capable. If another person serves as your shield against life itself, then you have mistaken companionship for cowardice.

What is growth but the willingness to be broken and reformed, like metal in the forge? The sword does not complain of the hammer's blows. It understands that comfort would leave it brittle, useless. When you seek someone to make you "feel safe," examine this desire: Do you seek a fellow soldier who will stand beside you in life's battles, or do you seek exemption from the battle itself?

Nature shows us that nothing living is ever truly safe. The seed must crack open, the bird must leave the nest, the river must flow toward the unknown sea. Safety is the illusion we construct when we forget that we are already dying, already changing, already in motion toward our end. 

True companionship - what some name love - is finding another who reminds you of your duty to live fully before that end arrives. Not safety from growth, but courage for it. Not shelter from change, but a witness to your transformation. The question is not whether they make you feel safe, but whether they make you feel alive to what must be done today.

> *Director: Marcus Aurelius hasn't spoken yet and can offer a pragmatic Stoic perspective that bridges Nietzsche's fierce individualism and Watts' Eastern non-dualism, while grounding the discussion in practical wisdom*

### **Alan Watts**

Oh, but Marcus, you're still making it all so terribly serious, aren't you? All this business about duty and battles and preparation - as if life were some sort of military campaign we must win! But what if the whole show is more like a dance than a war?

You see, when we talk about feeling "safe" with someone, we're usually expressing a rather profound confusion about what we actually are. We imagine ourselves as these separate little islands of consciousness, desperately trying to build bridges to other islands, when in fact we're all waves in the same ocean pretending we're not wet!

The joke is that we're looking for safety from life while being life itself. It's like a whirlpool in a stream being afraid of water. When you truly understand that you and your beloved are both expressions of the same fundamental energy that grows the trees and spins the galaxies, then this whole question of safety versus growth dissolves like sugar in tea.

Consider how children play - they feel perfectly safe with their playmates precisely because they're growing, exploring, becoming. They're not safe in spite of the adventure; they're safe because of it. The safety comes from knowing that someone else is playing the same game, by the same rules, with the same gorgeous pointlessness.

What we call "falling in love" is really the recognition that here's someone with whom we can stop pretending we're not playing. And that's simultaneously the ultimate safety and the ultimate growth - to finally admit that we've been making it all up as we go along anyway, and isn't it marvelous?

> *Director: Watts can bridge the apparent opposition between Nietzsche's fierce individualism and Marcus's disciplined acceptance, while also responding to Marcus's naturalistic observations with Eastern perspectives on non-duality*
