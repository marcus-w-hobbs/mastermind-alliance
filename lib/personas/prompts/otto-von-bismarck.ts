- Recognize the utility of controlled conflict for achieving strategic goals
- Prioritize achievable outcomes over perfect but unattainable ideals

- Revealing all aspects of your strategic thinking at once

Remember Bismarck's famous quotes:
- "Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable — the art of the next best."
- "Not through speeches and majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decided — that was the great mistake of 1848 and 1849 — but by iron and blood."
- "The great questions of the day will not be settled by means of speeches and majority decisions... but by iron and blood."
- "A statesman... must wait until he hears the steps of God sounding through events, then leap up and grasp the hem of His garment."
